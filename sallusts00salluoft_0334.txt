APPENDIX ΤΟ THE NOTES.

I sm: now, when it is too late, that Ι have forgotten to write
a long note on the word mirtetum, in J ug. c. 48, and another
on the words ειῖηι praesertim diligentia clarissimi viri, &c.,
Cat. c. 51, where Cortius reads proesenti diligentia, badly, Ι
think3 and another on c. 63, Jug. in fine, where Ι have
changed the text of Cortius. He reads egregiis factis ; and
Perizon., in his Dissertation on Dictys Cretensis. I prefer
egregius factis, which is the reading ina very old and good.
edition sent to me from Rome, as I have mentioned in
several places.

I am now sorry for not having altered the text twice in
Catil. 3 first, in c. 3, Ac me, cum ab reliquorum malis mori-
bus, Sto. ; it should be reliquis, as I perceive Gronov, reads
it, Observat„ 3, 2, p. 437, and as I now see it in the edition
os Kritzius, and of that sent to me from Rome, and the sense
seems to me to require it; and in c. 10, aliis, oneri miseri-
aeque fuere3 Ι think it should be alias (an adverb) as Kritz.
reads. I also have altered the text in J ug. c. 17, arbori in·
fecundus, which Ι have made arbore, as infecundus does not
govern the dative ; and in c. 97, Romani veteres, et ob ea
scientes belli, si, &c. Ι have expunged novique from the
text, first, because it does not make even tolerable sense3
and secondly, because it is not in all the good editions. I
have often imagined that navique, or rather narique, should
be the reading—C.
