Italiae finem faceret. Sed priusquam hujuscemodi rei

that Muretus uses in quoting it, qui mos est istorum hominum, as
Toup says in his Epist. Crit. See also the very learned Markland, in
his comments on the Supplices of Euripid. at v. 901, ubi, he says:
lambos fortuitos in scriptoribus Prosaicis saepe deprehendas. In N.
F. centum ad minimum Senarios Tragicos (comicos sine numero) licet
observare, et ex iis multos pulcherrimos, ut Luc. 5, 21, Τίς soa-m οὗτος,
ἒς λαλεῖ βλασφημιας ; et ib. v. 39. Ad Ephes. 5, 25, and many others,
which I shall not transcribe, as this note is already too prolix.—C.

³ Quo ad coynosceudum omnia, &c.] Coynoscend. is to be taken
passively here. See Perizon. on Sanct. 3 Minerv. lib. 3, c. 8, p. 451 3

rendered into English so, that it is really so ἶ) Does that change the
radical import of the word, or the part of speech to which it belongs?
All schoolboys know that the half of the ad jectives we meet with in
poeti-y, may be translated as adverbs; but are they, for that reason,
adverbs ⁴? I think it much more consonant to reason and analogy that
the gerunds should have a passive significat-ion, than that. they should
have an active one, being participles os passive, and not active verbs;
as, coquoseendum here from coynoscendus. See Perizon. on Sanct.
Miner-v. lib. 3, c. 8, note 10, who has quoted this sentence, and Ob-
sequens de Prodig. e. 121, Ad immolandum bos sacra injussa adnata-
vit per hostium classem, seque ad aras percutiendam obtulit, that is,
ut immolaretur, to be sacrzficed, not to sacrifice, surely. Sec Sanct-
