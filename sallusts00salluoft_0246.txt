virtus, gloria, atque alia obtanda bonis superabant, ta-
men inerat contemtor animus et superbia, commune no-
bilitatis malum. Itaque primum commotus insolita re,
mirari ejus consilium, et quasi per amicitiam monere,
“ ne tam prava inciperet, neu super fortunam animum
gereret: non omnia omnibus cupiunda esse: debere illi
res suas satis placere: postremo caveret id petere a po-
pulo Romano, quod illi jure negaretur.'’ Postquam haec
atque talia dixit, neque animus Marii flectitur; respon-

⁴ contubernio patris] In the Roman camps, those who lodged in
the same tent, being commonly eight or ten, were said to be in contu-
bernio, or were called contubernales. And the young noblemen who
attended the army, under the care and inspection of the general, in
order to gain some experience in military affairs, were commonly
lodged in the general’s tent or pavilion, and so were on that account
called imperatoris contubernales, or said to be in ejus contubernia—M.
