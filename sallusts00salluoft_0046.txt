only.

In leap-year, which is every fourth year, February hath twenty-nine
days, and both the ‘24th and 25th are called the sixth of the kalends
of March ; and hence this year is called bissextilis.

The following verses show the number of days in each mouth, and
contain a summary of what has been said. The table represents the
manner of computation ς in which observe, that the numbers refer to
the words below them :—

szins, Aprilis, Septemque, Novemque tricenos,
Unum plus reliqui ς F ebruus tenet octo viginti ς
At si bissextus fuerit, superadditur unus.

Tu primam mensis lucem dic esse kalendas,
