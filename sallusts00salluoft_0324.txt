310 SALLUSTII J UGURTHIN ΠΜ.

gressi.2 Sed ubi plerumque noctis processit, Sulla a
Boccho occulte arcessitur: ab utroque tantummodo fidi
interpretes adhibentur : praeterea Dabar internuncius,
sanctus vir, et ex sententia³ ambobus. Ac statim sic
Rex incipit.

CX. “ Nunquam ego ratus sum fore, uti Rex maxu-
mus in hac terra, et omnium, quos novi privato homini
gratiam deberem. Et hercle, Sulla, ante te cognitum,
multis orantibus, aliis ultro egomet opem tuli, nullius

indigui. Id imminutum, quod caeteri dolere solent ego
laetor : fuerit mihi eguisse¹ aliquando amicitiae tuae, qua
apud animum meum nihil carius habeo. Id adeo expe·

would elicit dicit out of jubet, See note on cap. 8-2, and on 14th of
Jug.--C.

³ Ambo in sua castra diyressi] Commentators are much divided as
to the meaning of this expression ; some take ambo to refer to Bocchus
and Sulla3 but Cortius is positive that Sallust means Aspar and Sulla.
Some again take castra to signify the camp of Bocchus, and that
formed by Sulla and the party who came along with him3 which two
eamps we may suppose to have been at no great distance from one
another. But Cortius will have it, that the two camps here meant- are,
the one that of J ugurtha, which was a good way off, as may be ga-
thered from cap. 112, since it took Aspar eight days in going to it and
returning back ; and the other that of Marius, in and about Cirta,
which are still at a greater distance: and he takes digressi to impert,
not that they actually went, but that they parted for, or as if they had
been raeolved to go to their respective campa-M.

¹ Sanctus—et ex sententia] This construction is elegant, and very
much akin to utilia, aut benevolentiae, cap. 103.-M.

CX. ¹ Fuerit mihi ejecisse, &c.] See Gronov. observat, lib. 4, p.
116, and seq. ς and Kritzius here, and it will not be necessary to con-

sult any other. Anthou reads, Fuerit mihi pretium, badly, more su0.
and has no note—C.
