146 SALLUSTII JL‘GURTHINUM.

proviso, J ugurtha, intoleranda audaciz‘i, scelere, atque su-
per-bid, sese efferens, fratre meo, atque eodem propinquo
suo, interfecto, primum regnum ejus sceleris sui praedam
fecit : post, ubi me isdem dolis nequit capere, nihil mi· '
nus, quam vim,⁶ aut bellum exspectantem, in imperio
vestro, sicuti videtis, extorrem patria, domo, inopem et
coopertum miseriis effecit, ut ubivis tutius, quam in meo
regno essem. Ego sic existumabam‚ Patres conscripti,

tus plebes. consulatum nobilitas inter se per manus tradebat3 where
yerebat is understood. See Perizonius at Sanct. Minerv„ pp. 313, 713,
where he shows that the same construction occurs also in the Greek;
as do also J ensius and VValker, on Lucian 3 Ernesti on Xenoph. supra;
Eustathius on Homer, et quis non‘? This kind of construction is not
tolerated in English, nor in French, in the opinion of Beauzee, Rollin,
and the author of the Port Royal Grammar (see p. 420). But there
are examples to be found in the best French poets. See Girard’s Sy—
nonym„ vol. 2, pp. 542, 572, where lines are adduced from the poet
Racine, precisely similar in construction to the passages 1 have quoted.
I think I could prove even from Tasso's Gerusal. Liberata, or Jerusa-
lem Delivered, that similar phrases occur in the Italian language3 but
this note is already too diffuse. I should not, however, omit Liv. lib.
2, c. 60, Tum duci, tum propter ducem Patribus quoque placatior
exercitus rediit3 where my friend, the unparalleled Mr. Walker, notoe
thus : Duci nempe addictus ; patribus placatior: namque exercitus
Quinctio nunquam fuerat iratus. Here, again, the word understood
takes a tincture from the word expressed ς and cinyi seems to be un·
dei-stood in Liv. 1, 33, Id non muro solum, sed etiam conjungi urbi
placuit; and id. c. 23, Tum indole animi, tum spe victoriae ferocior
erat: where ferox is understood in the former part of the sentence.

⁵ Pestis ejecta] By pestis we are to understand the Carthaginians3

and by ejecta, their being subdued, and turned out of their possessivus

in Africa by the Romans—M.
⁸ Nihil mimis, quizm vim, sce] Modus dicendi, quo notatur vim ac
bellum plane non timuisse—M.
