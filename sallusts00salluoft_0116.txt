104 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

dispositis praesidiis, Lentulum in carcerem deducit:
idem fit caeteris per Praetores. Est locus in carcere,
quod Tullianum,2 adpellatur‚ ubi paullulum descenderis
ad laevam, circiter duodecim pedes humi depressus. Eum
muniunt undique parietes, atque insuper camera, lapideis
fornicibus vincta: sed inculta, tenebriS, odore foeda at-
que terribilis ejus facies est. In eum locum postquam
demissus Lentulus, quibus precaeptum erat, laqueo gu-
lam fregere. Ita ille patricius, ex clarissuma gente Cor-
neliorum, qui consulare imperium Romae habuerat, dig-
num moribus factisque suis exitum vitae invenit. De
Cethego, Statilio, Gabinio, Caepario eodem modo suppli-
cium sumptum.³ ·

² Tullianum] Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome, enlarged
and finished the public prison begun by Aneus Martius, and init made
this dungeon, which from his name was called Tullianum. For the
construction, sec J ug. cap. xix. note 9.-Μ,

⁸ Supplicium sumptum] Cicero caused these conspirators to be exe-
cuted in the prison, upon the bare sentence of the senate, without
bringing the affair before the assembly of the people (as was usual) ς
which was afterwards improved against him by his enemies, and
brought such an odium upon him, as Sallust hints, cap. xxii. that at
the instigation of Clodius, Tribune of the Commons, he was actually
banished out of Italy, his houses demolished both in town and country,
and his goods set to sale, but was very honourably recalled about six-
teen months after. Itis related that Cicero, as he returned from this
execution, upon observing a great number of the conspirators‘ friends
and accomplices, who did not know that they had been put to death,
but were preparing to rescue them 111 the night, turned towards the
multitude, and with a loud voice cried out, vixerunt, or, they have
lived ; a soft expression used by him on this occasion, instead of the
harsher words, mortui sunt, or, they are dead. This happened on the
5th of December, A. U. 691.-M.
