19 i SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM.

legionis per munitionem, quam uti defenderet, acceperat,
locum hostibus introeundi dedit: eaque Numidae cuncti
irrupere. Nostri foeda fuga, plerique abjectis armis,
proxumum collem occupavere. Nox atque praeda cas-
trorum hostes quo minus victoria uterentur, remorata
sunt.⁵ Dein Jugurtha, postero die cum Aulo in colloquio

verba facit: “tametsi ipsum cum exercitu fame, ferro

the triarii or pilani‚ was denominated primus pilus, or primipilus, or
centurio primi pili, and the next, secundus pilus, διο. And as the order
of triarii was more honourable than that of the principes, and the prin‘
cipes than the hastati, it naturally followed that the centurio primi pili
was superior to all the eenturions in the legion. This officer, besides
his name of primipilus, was known by several other honourable titles,
as dux legionis, praefectus legionis, primus centurio, and primus centu-
rionum. He had the care of the eagle or chief standard of the legion;
and hence aquilae praecesse, is to bear the dignity of primipilus. Nor
was this statIOn only honourable, but also profitable, for he had an ex-
traordinary stipendium allowed him: hence Juven. Sat. xiv. v. 197,
Ut locupletem aquilam tibi sexagesimus annus adferat. When he left
the service, he was reputed equa] to one of the equestrian order, and
bore the title of primipilarius 3 as those who had discharged the highest
offices of the state were styled ever after consulares, censorii, praetorii,
quaestorii, and AEdilitii. ΤΙιθ rod called vitis was not particular to
primipilus, but common with him to all the centinions, as being the
badge of their office; and hence vitem poscere, signifies to sue for a
centurion's place or post.—M.

⁵ Remorata sunt] Vid. Perizon. ad Sanct. Minerv., lib. 4, c. 10, p.
720, treating of Syllepsis; and Vechner. Hellenolex. lib. 1, c. 15, §Z
p. 158, who have produced almost all the examples of this figure in
the Latin language.——C.

⁰ Fame, ferro clausum, &c.] The figure, zeugma, takes place here,
as clausum belongs properly to serro only. See Cortius here, and at
c. 14 and 49, Uti quemque pecunia aut honore extulerat. I think
that fame ferroque would be a better reading here—C.
