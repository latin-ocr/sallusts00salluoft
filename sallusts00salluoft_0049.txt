SALLUSTII CATILINA. 37

dominationiS‚ spes hortabatur, quam inopia, aut alia

nobilium, Catilinae inceptis fvebat, quibus in otio vel bf*

magnifice, vel molliter viv e copia erat, incerta pro

lib. 9, c. 1. Mense Aprili may be found in the letter of Asinius Pollio
to Cicero, lib. 10, Ep. 33, ad Divers.—-C.

² E'z· equestri ordine] The equites, or Roman knightS, were at first
no other than the life-guards of Romulus, consisting of three hundred
young men, and called celeres, α ministerii celeritate. Tarquinius
Priscus afterward increased their number to six hundred. But they
had no authority, and made no figure in the state, till A. tr. 631, when
C. Gracchus, tribune of the commons, found means to transfer the
power of judging corrupt magistrates from the senate to the equites.
This produced a remarkable change in the government. The Roman
citizens came now to consist of three orders, viz„ the senator-ian, eques-
trian, and plebeian ; and persons were admitted into the two former
according to their fortunes. One that was worth eight hundred ses-
εει-ἦα, was capable of being chosen a senator; one that had four hun-
dred, might be taken into the equestrian order. These equites, or
knights, had a gold ring and a horse allowed them at the public
charge—M.

³ Eae coloniis et municipiis] Coloniae were towns, stanes, or com-
munities, where the chief part of the inhabitants had been transplanted
from Rome, who, mingling with the natives, obtained the chief autho—
rity, and managed the administration according to the Roman laws.
Municipia (commonly rendered free towns, enfranchised towns, hanse
towns, or borough towns) were corporations or cities, who, for their
good services, or upon other considerations, were allowed the use of
their own laws, and at the same time honoured with the immunities
and privileges of Roman citizens. See Kennet, B. iv. ch. 18.-M.
