qui (aliqui or nonnulli being understood), the following verb must al-
ways be in the imperfect subjunctive (see note on J ug. c. 25) ; but it
is otherwise when the verb sum is in the present ten-se. In this case
the verb is sometimes in the indicative, and sometimes in the subjunc-
tive, not promiscuously, however, as I shall show. Crombie says, in
his “ Gymnasium,'’ that when there is a periphrase with esse, nonnulli
being understood, the subjunctive is generally, if not always used (see
his doubt about it) ς as, sunt qui dicant is the same as nonnulli dicunt 3
and esse means existere in such sentences. See his work quoted, in
which he givos rules for the use of the subjunctive mood. Ex-

istunt qui have a similarconstruction, asJuv enal, Sat. 12, v. 101, Ex-

istunt qui promittant hecatomben. Hegi‘singer on Cic. Off. 1, c. 24, has
proved that sunt qui have not always the subjunctive mood, as Hor.

Od. 1, 7, 5, Sunt, quibus unum opus est intactae Palladis urbem, &c ε
to which may be added lib. 1, Od. 1, 1, and lib. 1, Sat. 4, v. 24, but
some of the examples produced by him are oeaegwbm'wm. In the sen-
tence from Cic. Off. 1, 24, Sunt enim qui, . . . non audent dicere, Er-
nesti reads audeant, which, he says, Latinitas postulat. Hefisinger says,
in his long note, Facile tamen largior esse locos, quibus uterque modus
aeque eleganter accommodari possit. This shows that he knew not the
difference between the two expressions, which depends 011 the nature of
the relative qui. The “ Port Royal Grammaire generale et taissonee''
sayS, sometimes the relative stands for a conjunction, and a pronoun
demonstrative; as Liv. 1, No. 56, Is cum primores civitatis, in quibus
fratrem suum ab avunculo interfectum audisset. In quibus is visibly
for et in his. Sometimes it is used for a conjunction only ; aS, Liv. 8,
No. 37, Marcus Flavius Tribunus plebis tulit ad populum, ut in Tus-
culanos animadverteretur, quorum eorum ope ac consilio Veliterni po-
pulo Rom. bellum fecissent. Some think we should read here, quod
eorum ope ; but the best editions read as above, and the most ancient
MS. too. Plautus has used a similar phrase in his Trinummo, Inter
eos ne homines Condalium te redipisci postulaS, quorum eorum unus
surripuit currenti cursori solum ἶ) where quorum performs the same
office as if there had been cum· eorum unus surripuerit, &c. ε and some-
