orationis naturam sequatur. Ι think, then, that Walker and Lechner
are quite right. (Having no edition of Plaut.‚ Ι cannot examine the
sentence I have transcribed from a bad edition). Quisque is an ano-
malous word, under subjection to no syntactical rule3 but like ἄναξ,
which Duportus⁷ on Theopr. Charaet. p. 394, ed. Needham, says, Pro
suo imperio a lege communi et regula descivit3 or, like Homer’s
Achilles, “ J ura negat sibi natass’ Ι imagine it might be called an
ἀκυςολογια, or impropriety of speech3 some of which expressions are
to be met with in, perhaps, all languages, and in the best authors 3 as
I think Eustathius remarks somewhere on Homer. Is not in praesen-
liar-um used by C. Nepos, Cato, Fannius, Tacitus, Apuleius, Minu-
cius Felix, &c., of this kind? See a very long note on it by Perizon.
on Sanc. lib. 2, 3. I have sometimes imagined it might be a con-
traction for in praesentia rerum, i. e., in praesenti statu rerum. But I
may say with the great Vossiua Hoc commentum ne mihi quidem
placet3 nedum aliis me illud probaturum sperem3 yet one learned
friend of mine likes it much. Is not methinks as anomalous as any
expression in any language ἱ) Sed jam satis superque.—C.

⁴ Ipsi Numidas adpellavere] Numidoe is derived from the Greek
verb, νεμεῖν, to feed. They took this name, because they were fed or
maintained by strolling about from place to place like grazing cattle·
