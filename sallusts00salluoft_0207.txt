4 Centurio primi pili] A legion, when drawn up in battle-order
consisted of three lines, placed parallel to, and behind one another, with
large spaces of ground, like streets or avenues, between them. The
first or foremost of these lines were called the hastati, from the spears
which they used to fight with. The middle line were the principes;
so called, because in ancient times, before the institution of the hastati,
they composed the first line, and began the fight. The third or last
line were the triarii 3 so called from their position, as being marshalled
in the third rank: they were also called pilani, or pilarii, from their
weapons, the pila. Now, each of these lines was divided into ten ma-
nipuli3 and three manipuli, viz., one out of the hastati, one out of the
principes, and one out of the triarii, made a cohort ι by this means the
legion consisted of ten cohorts. Each manipulus had a commanding
officer, called a centurion ; and sometimes two, who, according to their
dignity or place of honour, were denominated primus, secundus, ter-

named primus hastatus, and the next in dignity to him secundus has-
