SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM. 225

Lx: Eodem tempore apud Zamam magna vi certaba-
tur. Ubi quisque legatus, aut tribunus curabat, eo acer-

rume niti; neque in alio magis quam in sese spem ha-
bere: pariter oppidani agere, propugnare, aut parare¹

long for transcription.—C.

LX.. ¹ Propuqnare, aut parare, &c.] The reading in the other edi—
tions is obpuynare, aut parare, &c. Anthon says the former of these
two verbs, namely, oppuynare, or obpuynare, refers to the Romans,
the latter to the Numidians. “They prosecuted the attack, or resisted
the assailants.” “ After parare understand defensionem.'’ Altogether
in error, as usual. Where is the word defensio understood? Why
has he not given an example of the ellipsis of this word? He could
not: it is never understood. And Boyd is silent here. Ι am truly
grieved that the arduous task, and viribus meis impar, of correcting
Sallust, has not devolved upon some learned professor, that might
have the means and materials at hand, of which Ι am deprived 3 as I
am possessed of only a small private library. I must, however, try
what I can do. And, first, Ι say that I am quite surprised that the
text of Crispus should have been allowed to remain corrupt for so many
years. There is no person more reluctant to change or alter the text
than 1 am; but when no sense can be elicited from it by the most
able commentators, what are we to do ⁴? Certainly to alter the text,
even without the authority of a MS. Good sense cannot be elicited
from the text here3 therefore, a slight change must be made. You
see Anthon’s translation. Mair’s is, ‘⁴ assaults were providiny, or de-
fences providiny (against them) in all places.'' Where is the shadow
' of proof that oppuynare (the common reading) refers to the Romans,
and parare to the N umidians ‘? I challenge any classical scholar in
Europe to produce an exactly parallel passage. Three most celebrated
scholars and critics say we should read propugnare, which I have
introduced into the text. Their names are Uolesus, ciacconius, and the
justly ceiebrated J. Fred. Gronovius. 1 simu transcribe thev words of
