318 SA LLUSTII JUGURTHINUM.

gloria certare. Sed postquam bellum in Numidia con-
fectum, et J ugurtham vinctum adduci Romam nuncia-

the Gallie name was more formidable to them than that of any other
nation whatsoever.—M.

⁵ Marius Consul absens factus] This shows the high opinion the
people then entertained of Marius 3 for it was a thing exceeding rare,
and very extraordinary, nay‚ it was a dispensing with the law itself‚
which forbade any one to be elected Consul in his absence, or to be re·
chosen, till ten years at least had intervened.-M.

⁵ Kalendis Januariis maynd ylorid Consul triumphavit] This was
the year of Rome, 649, and the day on which the new Consuls entered
upon their office, which was a great solemnity by itself; but as it was
also the day of the triumph, we may well suppose that the pomp and
splendour in which Marius then appeared, were such as abundantly
justifies our author in saying, Magna gloria triumphavit. On this
occasion, Marius exhibited a sight to the Romans, which they scarcely
expected ever to have seen, Ι mean J ugurtha in chains, as we leam
from Eutrop. IV., cap. 28, Ante currum Marii J ugurtha cum duobus
tiliis ductus est catenatus. And Plutarch, in his Life of Marius, in-
forms us that J ugurtha, as he walked in the procession, ran distracted.
After the ceremony was over, he was cast into prison3 and the lictors
were so eager to seize his robe, that they rent it in several pieces, and
tore away the tips of his ears to get the rich Jewels with which they
were adorned. In this condition he was thrown stark naked into a
deep dungeon, that was to be his grave3 upon going down into
which, vultu in risum verso, he uttered these words, Hercules quam
frigidum nobis est balneum! Here, after struggling six days with
cold and hunger, he ended his wicked life by a wretched death. Agree—

able to this account are the following verSeS, subj0ined to some of the
old manuscripts :—

“ Nosse cupis vulgo non cognita fata J ugurthae,
Ut Plutarchus ait, carcere clausus obit.'’
