186 SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM.

que ministris ea egerit, quamquam intellegat populus
Romanus ; tamen velle manifesta magis ex illo habere :
si vera aperiat, in fide et clementia populi Romani mag-
nam spem illi sitam : sin reticeat, non socios saluti fore 3
sed se suasque,⁴ spes corrupturum.''

XXXIV. Dein, ubi Memmius dicundi finem fecit, et
J ugurtha respondere jussus est, C. Baebius, tribunus ple-
bis, quem pecunia corruptum supra diximus, Regem ta-
cere jubet: ac, tamen etsi multitudo, quae in concione
aderat, vehementer accensa, terrebat eum¹ clamore, voltu,
saepe impetu, atque aliis omnibus quae ira fieri amat:2

⁴ Non socios saluti fore; scd se sua-sq„ &c.] Ι have altered the
text here, for, I conceive, very good reasons. Ι find sed se suasq. in
a very old, and, Ι believe, excellent edition3 and that Ι have had good
grounds for changing sociis to socios, I shall now attempt to prove.
Dr. Harte, and Dr. Griffin, ex-Fellows of Tfinity College, Dublin, can
bear testimony to my having communicated this emendation to them,
at least twenty years ago. J ug. did not certainly go to Rome for the
purpose of procuring safety and impunity for his associate-3, and the
tools of his guilt3 but, having bad hopes in his affairs, or, as Ι would
say in Greek, ἀποξων δὲ καὶ &varmum-xm, or ἀνελπιζων, or ἀθυμουμενας
τοῖς παροῦσι πράγμασι, could not expect to ward off the attacks of his
enemies by any other means than the aid and power of the associates‚
whom he had obtained by bribery. Memmius, well aware of this, tells
him that the aid of his socii, or associates, would not avail him, unless
he acted with good saith, or honestly. I perceive, this moment, to my
great pleasure and satisfaction, that Kritzius also reads Socios—sed se
suasq., as I have given in the text—C.

² Quae ira fieri amat] Anthon’s note is this: Quae amat fieri (lite-
rally, “ which anger loves should be put in operation,”) is imitated
from the Greek idiom, φιλεῖ νγνγνεσθαι. Quintilian (9, 3, 17,) in
speaking of Saliust's frequent imitations of the Greek idiom, cites this
