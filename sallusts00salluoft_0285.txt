SALLUSTII J UGURTHINUM. 2 7 1

cujusque lubido erat, capite censos2 plerosque. Id fac-
tum alii inopia bonorum,³ alii per ambitionem Consulis
memorabant3 quod ab eo genere celebratus auctusque
erat ς* et homini potentiam quaerenti egentissumus-quis-
que opportunissumus: cui neque sua curae, quippe quae
nulla sunt3 et omnia cum pretio honesta videntur. Igi-
tur Marius cum majore aliquanto numero, quam decre-
tum erat, in Africam profectus, diebus paucis Uticam
advehitur. Exercitus ei traditur a P. Rutilio legato;

the first classis being the richest, and making the greatest figure, had
the peculiar name of classici, and all the rest, of what class soever,
were said to be infra classem3 and hence, too, the first-rate writers
among the Romans have got the name of classici auctores—M.

² Capite censos] The sixth classis consisted of the poorer sort of
citizens, and had very little to say in public affairs, the matter being
commonly determined before it came to their turn to vote. They were
scarcely ever listed for soldiers except on extraordinary occasions, as
being persons who had nothing to lose at home, and, therefore, under
the greater temptation of deserting to the enemy. They were divided
into two orders3 the first and more honourable were the proletarii, so
called from proles, because the bringing up of children was the greatest
service they did the state: the other order was the capite censi, so
called because they were entered and ‘valued in the rolls for their per-
sons only; but families, children, or estates, they had none: all they
could boast of, was, that they were not capite minuti, or had not lost
the privilege and right of citizens. Here observe, that Sallust opposes
classes to capite censi; and the reason is, because the whole sixth
classis, and particularly this last order was so inconsiderable, and in
so much contempt, that it was scarcely looked upon as a classis at all :
and accordingly Livy and other Roman historians, when speaking of
the classes, scarce mention ever more than five—M.

² Inopia bonorum] Boni sunt ditiores, qui sunt in classibus-M.

⁴ Auctusque erat] Auctus nempe honore, promotus, et in eam dig-
nitatem evectus—M.
