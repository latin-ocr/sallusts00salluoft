102 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

'lia fuere :² magnitudo animi par, item gloria; sed alia
alii. Caesar beneficiis et munificentia magnus habebatur ;
integritate vitae Cato. Ille mansuetudine et mesericor-

easiness‚ and clemency Sallust celebrates him for, were in him arts or
tricks, practised purely with a view to acquire and secure to himself
the possession of an arbitrary power over his fellow-citizens. Shall any
man be accounted or styled mild and merciful, whose insatiable thirst
after power made him wade through seas of blood to come at it ⁸? he
was not a whit better man than Catiline‚ but had a great deal more
cunning, and much greater abilities, whereby he at length exeented
with success, what the other attempted only to his own destruction.
Cato was a brave and worthy patriot. And to compare two such men
together, whose characters were as opposite to one another, as black
and white, in the manner Sallust has done, was vile daubing, setting a
gloss upon the most extreme wickedness, to give it the air and lnstre
of virtue.’'

As Mr. Clarke looks upon this compar-ison betwixt Cato and Caesar
with abhorrence and indignation, so he brings a heavy and odious
charge against Sallust for being the drawer of it. But I am of opi-
nion, that, upon due examination‚ it will be found there is no just
ground for such a censure. It is far less diffieu1t‚ as well as much
safer to draw characters of men after their death, than in the time of
their liff'e. It is an easy matter for us now, upon looking back to the
history of those times, to see a great disparity in these two men's cha-
racters: that the one regulated his behaviour by principles of virtue
and honour 3 that a vicious, unbounded ambition influenoed and directed
the conduct of the other ; that Cato lived and died a true patriot, and
that Caesar aggrandized himself upon the ruin of the public. But the
case was quite otherwise with Sallust at the time when he wrote this
history, which was about the year of Rome 7 03 or 704, and so about
a year or two before the civil wars broke out betwixt Caesar and Pom-
pey 3 as M. le Clerc, in his life of Sallust makes highly probable. At
this time Caesar's character was fair3 he was a man of extraordinary
abilities‚ of an insinuating and invincible eloquence, greatly beloved by
the people on account of his generosity, was an able minister of state, a
glorious and successful general, and had not made the least open at-
tempt upon the liberties of his country. Sallust could not know the
