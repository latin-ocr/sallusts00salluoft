SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM. 183

cere, id cst regem esse. Neque ego, Quirites, hortor ut
malitis civis vestros perperam, quam recte fecisse3 sed
ne, ignoscendo malis, bonos perditum eatis. Ad hoc in

the words id reyem esse above, he says eum is understood3 another
blunder. It is aliquem or te, not eum. Why has not another writer
used puer, in this sentence, Nescire quid anteaquam natus sis acciderit,
id est semper esse puerum :2 Professor Anthon would read puer. He
should have studied the Nouvelle Methode, or Port Royal Grammar,
on the nse of the infinitive mood3 (see my first note on Catil.) ς and
Zump's Latin Grammar, ξ 80, 8, before he had the temerity to write
on what he did not understand. Why has not Boyd corrected Anthou
here ἱ) I do not see in what respect he has improved the Sallust of
the American. Ι know he has greatly injured that valuable work,
Adam's Roman Antiquities. I recollect to have heard my teacher say
that two of the best classical scholars of the north of Ireland carried
on a long, wordy, and wicked war about the sentence I have quoted
from Cic. de Orat. 34, Nescire quid acciderit, &c.3 one of them stu-
pidly insisting3 but without the shadow of proof, like the professor of
the New World, that it- should be puer. Oh, how difficule to find a
person conscious of his ignorance! W⁷here is this more usual construc-
tion os his to be found? Not in Latin. Let us try the Greek3 but
that is Orzo non fatto pei suoi denti, as the Italians say. Aristot„
«τὸ χιὶξειν τας μιμήμασι πάντας, σύμφυτον τοῖς bregden-015 ἐστὶ. This
thing or circumstance, that all should delight in imitations, is natural
to men. Such expressions as {n τῷ εἶναι obv-riv, are very commonin the
New Testament3 but, perhaps, the inhabitants of the Nem World
have made mme discovery in classical learning as yet unknown to the
inhabitants of the Old ; as we are indebted to them for that of steam,
Professor Anthou can get over all classica] difficulties with steam ex-
pedifion. No more at present about this gentleman; but much more
her-caster, Θεου θέλοντας. Ι could easily produce a hundred examploe
of the construction of our author3 but I shall not insult the judgment
of the learned. At ch„ 85, Mr. A„ seems to have put on his spectacles ς
for, he says, “with esse understand te, so that dominum and impera-
torem, may be accusatives after the verb.” Ι ask, what else can they
be? See how haeitatingly he speaks—C.
