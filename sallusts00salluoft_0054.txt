42 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

sos3 numquam Hispanos praeterea tale facinus fecisse,⁵
sed imperia saeva multa antea perpessos. Nos eam rem
in medio relinquemus.⁷ De superiori conjuratione satis
dictum.

XX. Catilina, ubi eos, quos paullo ante memoravi,

times it serves instead of the demonstrative, and has nothing of the
conjunction. Thus far that excellent work: cic. Off. 1, 8, Nam, quic-
quid ejusmodi est, in quo non possunt plures excellere, δια, where Er-
nesti says, with truth, In quo, pro ut in eo, exquisitius, et sunt plura
hujus formoe exempla. Jones says in his Latin Grammar, p. 150, that
qui is καὶ, which exactly eorresponds with what the author of the
French Grammar above cited, says And as the relative is sometimes
used for a conjunction, so a conjunction disjunctive is sometimes used
for a conjunction copulative, and the relative pronoun. See the Gram-
mar above cited, and Crombie⁷s Gymnasium. Hertelius, on Tacit.
Agric. c. 28, extr. reads, Fuere, quos indicium tanti casus illustravit ;
which militates against Bentley's rule3 but I find in the first edition
of Tacit. with the Italian translation of the incomparable and immortal
Davantzati, illustraret in the subjunctive, and this frees Bentley from
erton—C.

⁵ Cn. Pompeii veteres fidosque clientes] This is a pure hexameter.
It is not probable that Sallust calls these Spaniards here clientes Pom-
peii in the common sense of the word, because Pompey was their pa-
tron. The meaning rather is, that Pompey had attached them to his
interest by special favours. And such Caesar, 1, Civ. cap. lxxv„ calls
beneficiarii. See cap. xxxi„ note 6.-M.

⁰ Nunquam Hispanos praeterea tale facinus fec-issa] Praeterea, in
time past.—-Mair. Turnebus, in his Adversar. book vi., c. 15, says,
idem (scil. Agraetius) exponit praeterea apud Sallustium pro praeterito
tempore et anteacto, non consueta sane significatione; sic enim scribit
(np. Agretius) praeterea praeteriti temporis—Sallust, as above. I
would render it, in any other instance, or, on any other occasion. The
learned Kritzius, who has written more notes on Sallust than any other
editor, Cortius scarcely exeepted, has no note on this word—C.

⁷ In medio relinquemus] Nec affirmabimus, nec negabimus, ita ut
suum cuique liberum sit judicium.—-M.
