viri idem adsequi nequiverint, et postea quae genera ho-
minum in senatum pervenerint; profecto existumabunt,
me magis merito, quam ignavia, judicium animi muta·
visse, majusque commodum ex otio meo, quam ex alio-
rum negotiis reipublicae venturum. Nam saepe audivi,
Q. Maxumum, P. Scipionem, praeterea civitatis nostrae
praeclaros viros, solitos ita dicere, CUM MAJORUM IMA-
(ΠΝΕΞ4 1NTUERENTUR, VEHEMENTISSUME sun Am·-
MUM AD VIRTUTEM Acanm. Scilicet non ceram
illam, neque figuram, tantam vim in sese habere; sed
memoria rerum gestarum eam flammam egregiis viris in
pectore crescere, neque prius sedari, quam virtus eorum
famam atque gloriam adequaverit. At contra, quis est
omnium his moribus,⁵ quin divitiis et sumptibuS, non
probitate neque industria cum majoribus suis contendat?
etiam homines novi, qui antea per virtutem soliti erant

he sided with Caesar, and was by him made Quaestor a second time,
and afterwards Proetor. He attended Caesar in his expedition into
Africa, where he acquired the wealth which he afterwards laid out upon
the famous gardens called from his name, Horti Sallustiana—M.

⁴ Majorum imagines] It was a privilege and honour peculiar to the
nobility, or such as had borne curule offices, to be allowed to erect sta-
tues for themselves. These statues were set up in the area, or en-
trance to their houses, and were kept with great care by their posterity.
A nobleman valued himself upon having a great number of them, as
being an argument of the antiquity of his family; and such a person
is, in cap. lxxxv. called Homo multarum imayinum.—M.

⁵ His moribus] i. e. moribus hujus temporis. Thus, Cat. cap. li„
Atque ego haec non in M. Tullio, neque his temporibus vereor. Cap.
lviii„ Quia illa foeda atque intoleranda viris videbantur, haec sequi de-
crevistis—M.

His moribus] Add Cat. c. 7.-C.
