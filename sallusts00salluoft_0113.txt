SALLUSTII CATILINA. 1 Ο 1

atque desidia civitas corrupta est ς rursus respublica
magnitudine sua imperatorum atque magistratuum vitia
sustentabat; ac sicuti effoetae parentum,9 multis tempes-
tatibus haud sane quisquam Romae virtute magnus fuit.
Sed memoria mea ingenti virtute, divorsi moribus fuere
viri duo, M. Cato et C. Caesar3 quos, quoniam res obtu-

que naturam et mores, quantum ingenio possem, aperi-

LIII. ¹ Ac sicuti effoeta parentum] Ac, sicuti effoeta parens, in·-
ter parentes, sese habere solet, ut nullos amplius liberos proferat3 sie
Roma sese habuit, ubi multis tempestatibus nemo virtute magnus fuit.

Sicuti effoetae parentum] Ι perceive Anthou reads effoeta parente ;
and renders, “ the parent being, as it were, exhausted.'' Effoetae in
the gen. by a sort of apposition, as Romoe is in the gen., is the correct
reading. Gronovius, in his Observations‚ has written many pages in
trying to prove that effoeta agrees with tempestate, taken out of tem·-
pestatibus ; and then he, all at once, retracts what he has written, and
asserts, most peremptorily, that effoeta is in the abl. ease, agreeing
with virtute in the subsequent clause of the sentence. I much prefer
effoetae in apposition with Romae.—-C.

LIV. ¹ Iyz'tur his yenns] Mr. John Clarke, in his preface to Sal-
lust, is highly offended at the comparison here drawn betxw'xt Cato and
Caesar3 but at the same time he frankly acknowledgeS, that this is the
only material fault he knows in Sallust. Some of his words are, “ It
is an outrage upon common sense, to run a parallel betwixt two men
of such opposite characters, so as to leave it at last a disputable point
which was the greater and better of the two. Caesar was indeed a
person of vast abilities 3 but then he had nothing in him that bore any
resemblance of a virtue, but what was directly intended to promote the
· worst and most wicked desig-n that can enter into the heart of men 10
conceive, the destruction of the liberties of his country. The generosity,
