num deducit.

⁸ Aqmen constituit] Cortius, after a long dissertation on the verb
constitit, concludes that it is sometimes taken actively, and to be un-
derstood so in this place. His words are, Nam et sisto, est stare facio.
si ita loqui liceat3 ergo consisto est, curo, ut omnes desistant ab eundo,
ut omnes stent. Sic. Caes. 1. Civ. cap. 41, Potestate faeta, Afranius
copias eduxit, et in medio colle suh castris constitit.—M.

Aymen constituit] is the correct reading, as consistere is always
intransitive—C.

⁹ Proximum hostis, i. e. hostes] Coneerning this phrase, see Pe-
rizon. at Sanct. Minerv. lib. 1, c. 16, p. 151 3 and Sanet. himself. Ad
is understood, as all scholars know. See also Catil. c. 11, Propius vir-
tutem; J ug. e. 18. See Gronov. on Liv. 11, 48, 5; Drakenborch, at
Liv. 1, 21, 13 and Gronov. Observat. 3, 3, p. 444.—C.

¹⁰ Triplicibus subsidiis] Metellus’s army, as now rangcd, consisted
of four lines; the first of which was the next to J11gurtha, and is
called prima acies, or principia3 the other three lines, that were drawn
up behind the first, and which here come under the name of subsidia,
or reserves, we may imagine to have been the hastati, the principes,
and the triarii-M.

¹¹ Inter manipulos] In forming any of the four lines mentioned
just now, there was left an empty space betwixt one manipulus and
another; and these vacant spaces Metellus fills up with the archers

and slingers.—M.

¹² Trana-orsis principiis] The meaning of these words may be thus
illustrated. Imagine, that, in the figure annexed to note 2, of the pre-
ceding chapter, the length of Metellus's army, as drawn up upon the
mountain, reached from A to B 3 in which position, as they all stand
with their faces to the south, the right wing will be at A, and the left
