CV. ¹ Cujus arbitratu] Arbitratus vox Ciceroni frequens, pro
judicio beneplacito. Noster leviore significatu accepit, et eujus arbi-
tratu dixit, pro quo praesente et voluntatem populi Romani observanter
-Μ.

² Funditorem Balearium] Insulae Baleares were the islands in the
Mediterranean, now called Majorea and Minorca. Flor. III., cap. 8,
tells us the inhabitants were famous slingers, as being trained up to
this art from their infanoy. The boys had no victuals allowed them
but what they brought down from the top of some high post with
their slings'. Cortius is pretty positive that peditum in this place is
superfluous and spurious Vox peditum a mala manu irrepsit, et
scripserat Crispus: cum praesidio equitum atque funditorum—M.

⁸Proetered sayittarii et cohors Peliyna] This sentence may be
thus supplied, Praeterea erant oum Sulla sagittarii, Sco. The Peligni
were a people in Italy, their metropolis was Corfinium3 another of
their chief towns was Sulma, famous for being the birth-place of ovid.

⁴ Cum velitaribus armis] The velites, so called a volando, were
Tirones, or young soldiers, who were not formed into distinct bodies or
companies, as the other orders. In battles they used to hover in loose
order before the hastati, and begin the fight. Their arms were of the
lighter sort, viz., the parma tripedalis, i. e. a buckler of three feet
diameter, made of wood, and covered over with leather3 a Spanish
sword, seven hastae or javelins for darting at the enemy, with a galea
or light casque for their head, made generally of the skin of some wild
beasts. See cap. 46, note 5.-M.
