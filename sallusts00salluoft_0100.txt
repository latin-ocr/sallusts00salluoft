de L. Cassio, P. Furio, P. Umbreno, Q. Annio, si depre-
hensi forent, supplicium sumendum decreverat. isque
postea, permotus oratione C. Caesaris, pedibus in sen-
tentiam³ Tib. Neronis⁴ iturum se dixerat3 quod de ea re,
praesidiis additis, referundum censuerat. Sed Caesar,
ubi ad eum ventum, rogatus sententiam a Consule, hu-
juscemodi verba locutus est ε

bus dubiis consultant, ab odio, amicitia, ira, atque mise-
ricordifi, vacuos esse decet. Haud facile animus² verum

⁸ Pedibus in sententiam] There were chiefly three ways by which
the members of the senate signified their assent to any thing proposed
in the house. 1. Verbo, by saying adsentio. 2. Nutu et sublata
manu, by nodding the head, and lifting up the hand. 3. Pedibus,
when the house divided, and all those who were of the same sentiment
went apart by themselves, and then, upon numbering hemis, the point
in disputo, was determined according to plurality.—M.

‘¹ Tib. Neronis] Qui adservandos tantisper in custodia, dum Cati-
lina debellaretur, et negotium totum exquisite pernosceretur, censuerat.

LI. ¹ Omnis homines, &c.] Peter Victorius, in his Var. Lect. lib.
27, c. 18, thinks that Sailust has here imitated Thucydides. The
words of tite Greek historiari are, μηδὲ τρισὶ, τοῖς αξυμφοςοταίτοις τῇ
ξῗ-ξχῇ, ἔικτῳ καὶ ἡδονῇ λόγων καὶ ἐπιεικείᾳ ἁμαξταινειν,’8ιε. I rather
think with Ormson, in his Extracts‚ and others, that the beginning of
this speech of Caesar is an imitation of this passage of Demosthenes:
1:321 μὲν -τους λέγοντας ἅπαντας μήτε πρὸς ’ἔχθραν oroma-eae λὸγον μη-
ἳενοι, μήτε πξδς χάριν. ἀλλ’ &eim-mro» ἕκαστος ἡγεῖτο, τοῦτ’ Amo-
φαιίνεσὲαι. To the same purpose also are the first lines of the celebrated
inscription over the Council Chamber of Toleda ε-

“ Nobles discreto,
Varones que gobernais a Toledo‚ En aquestos escalones,
Descch ad las aficiones, Codieias‚ amor, y miedo.”

Τ hus far the learned Ormson.—C.
