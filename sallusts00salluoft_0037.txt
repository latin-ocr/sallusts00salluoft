XII. ¹ Innocentia pro malivolentia] By innocentia in this place,
we are to understand abstinence from the base, oppressive, and wicked
methods of amassing riches, then in fashion. Such was the degeneracy
of the times, that any person who did abstain and keep himself clear
from these prevailing corruptions, was thought to do SO, not from a

love of virtue, or principle of integrity, but out of spite against, and in
opposition to, those who fell in with them3 and that in order to cast
reproach upon them and their way, and blacken their character by the
lustre of his example. And this Ι take to be the import of the word
malevolentia—M.

² Hebescere virtus, paupertas probro haberi, innocentia pro malevo-
lentia duci coepit.] The verb coepi, in the active voice, is followed by
an infinitivo in the active voice ς as, coepit agere ; but it is much better
to use it in the passive voice, when it is followed by an infinitive pas-
sive, as coeptum est αφ’, not coepit. So Livy has used it almost every-
where3 as, lib. 1, c. 57, “Tentata res est, si primo impetu capi Ardea
posset. ubi id parum processit, obsidione munitionibusque coepti premi
hostes.” So lib. 9, c. 42, “Deditio fieri capta? Ib. c. 33, “Tum
de persequendo hoste ayitarz' coeptum. Ib. c. 25, Trucidari coepti. Ib.
c. 43, Tum passim fuga coepta Samnitium fieri. Ib. 3, 38, Sed con-
temni coepti erant. Ib, c. ΤΟ, ΙΠ media primum acie vinci coeptz‘ ; pre—
seutly after, Sinistrum deinde cornu ab Quintio consule pelli coeptum.
Ib. 21, 8, Vineae coeptae agi3 in the same chapter, Oppidani distineri
eoepti sunt. Caesar, 1. 2, Bell. Gal. c. 6, lapides jaci coepti sunt. Lib.
4, c. 18, Diebus decem, quibus materia coeptz‘ erat comportari. Ib.
In quo pons institui caeptus est. Hist. Bell. African„ Pulvis ingens
conspici coeptus est. See Lambert Boss, Animadv. ad Scriptores
quosdam—Graecos, &c., p. 13, Specim. Animadv. Latinar. Sallust
bas not, therefore, written in so chaste and pure a style as Cicero, Livy,
Caesar, &c. Horace has not been more exact in the use of this verb
than Sallust. In lib. 1, Epist. 15, v. 27, he has Urbanus coepit ha-
beri, where Lambinus says, coeptus est haben· ; sic enim antiquiores
loquebantur3 and so, Varro de Re Rust. lib. 3, c. 6, De pavonibus
