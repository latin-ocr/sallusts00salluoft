268 SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM,

cam celebravere. Quis nobilitas freta, ipsa dissimilis
moribus, nos iHorum aemulos contemnit3 et omnis ho-
nores non ex merito, sed quasi debitos a vobis repetit.¹⁹
Caeterfim homines superbissumi procul errant. Majores
eorum omnia, quae licebat, illis reliquere, divitias, imar-
gines, memoriam sui praeclaram z virtutem 11011 reli-
quere ; neque poterant = 00 sola neque datur dono, neque
accipitur. Sordidum me 01 incultis moribus aiunt ; quia
parum scite convivium exorno, neque histrionem ullum,
neque pluris pretii coquum, quam villicum‚⁹⁰ habeo.²¹ quae
mibi lubet confiteri. Nam ex parente meo, et ex sanctis

¹⁹ Debitos a vobis repetit] Repetere est verbum eorum qui debita
poscunt.-M.

²⁰ Histrionem-coquum, qudm villicum] The histriones here meant
were buffoons, i. e. a sort of witty fellova, somewhat like the fools who
attend doctors on the stage in this country. Tbese 1110 noblemen in
Rome kept for their own diversion, and the entertainment of such as
frequented their houses, particularly at table3 they, by dancing, sing-
ing, and pieces of wit and drollery, kept the company men-y. The
coquus, or cook‚ was he who dressed the victuals, and among the an-
cient Romans, was one of the meanest slaves : but when luxury came
to prevail, their profession required great art and skill to please the
palates of the nobles, now grown nice and delicate3 and instead of one
or two cooks, some noblemen, in the luxurious days of Rome, would
keep fifty or an hundred, nay, some authors say, a thousand. The
villici were stewards or servants, who took care of noblemen’s estates,
and had the oversight of their country business. Now, in this dege-
nerate time, some noblemen valued themselves much more upon hav-
ing well-accomplished buffoons and cooks, than upon having faithful
and able stewards to take care of their estates in the country, and
would have purchased them at a far higher price. But in this Marius
differs from them—M.

²¹ Pluris pretii—habea] Habere non est aestimarQ sed possidere.
