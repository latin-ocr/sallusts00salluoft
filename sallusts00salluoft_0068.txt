56 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

bellum gerere, coercere omnibus modis socios atque civis,
domi militiaeque imperium atque judicium summum ha-

ing εᾶ the ablative, agreeing with formula decreti understood, is truly
supine and astonishing. Where at all is the word formula under-
stood? I say it never is. When a word has been expressed in the
antecedent part or clause of a sentence, it may, certainly, be under-
stood in the subsequen& as all schoolboys know3 but that is not the
case here. Again, how can maxima, the reading of all the editions
before this, agree with potestas ? Is it not too far separated from it?
To separate the adjective so far from its substantive or noun, appears
to me unprecedented3 especially in Sallust, an author of precision and
terseness, if I can use the expression. The sentence, as it stands in all
former editions, has always appeared to all good classical scholars,
quite dislocated or disjointed, without a parallel, and altogether dis-
sonant stom the style of Crispus. well, I shall grant, for the sake of
argument only, that maxima may agree with potestas ,· what shall we
do with mayistratui ἓ It evidently signifies the consul ; for no other
magistrate had the powers assigned to him that our author here enu-
merates. Mayistratus maz-imm, or summus, is the consul3 in Greek,
ὕπατος. But 1 deny that mayistratus nude sumtus, as the commentatore
say, that is, without an adjunct‚ or qualifying epithet‚ ever signifioe the
consul. He that will show me an example, erit mihi magnus Apollo.
Ι dreamed some time since of the emendation which I have given3 and
that there was a parallel passage in an author, that I have not. Do
not laugh, kind reader, at my having introduced into the text what I
learned from a dream. I well recollect having read a learned note of
Stephanus on Diogenes Laertius, in which he has corrected a most ob-
scure passage of that author from, or by means of, a dream. The
much and justly celebrated Claudius Salmasius also dreamed, as I see
in one of his epissses, of the manner of elucidating aver-y abstruse pas-
sage. The very learned F ellows of Trinity College, Dublin‚ to many
of whom I have communicated my thoughts about this sentence, in a
note written in Latin, think my emendation well founded and just :—
“ Principibus placuisse viris non minima laus est.’' I take the words,
per senatum to be a gloss. If the thing was done per senatum, it
must, of course, be mos Romanus ; and if mos Romanus, I think per
senatum altogether superfluous. ΜΓ. Anthon passes over all difficul-
