lend me the edition of our author by Kfitzius, from which I have made
several extracts, and would have made many more, had time and
health permitted me. I trust I shall yet have a better opportunity of
giving an exposition of my sentiments on this subject.-—C.

⁶ Capto Syphace, 8εο] Syphax and Masinissa were both kings in
Numidia, but reigned in different parts of it. The subjects of Syphax
were called Masaesati, and their capital was Cirta. Those of Masi-
nissa were the Myssali. But both these nations are better known by
the name of Numidiam, which was common to them. Their principal
strength consisted in their cavalry3 they always rode without saddles,
and some even without bridles 3 and hence Virgil‚ AEn. iv. v. 41, calls
them Numidae Infraeni. Syphax, in the beginning of the second
Punic war, sided with the Romans, but afterwards, upon marrying the
famous Sophonisba, the daughter of Asdrubal the Carthaginian, he
changed sides, and j0ined the Carthaginians. Gala, the father of Ma-

which happened soon after the commencement of the war, was reduced
to the brink of ruin, being seaveral times driven from his kingdom, des-
titute of forces, money, and almost all things else. However, during
the course of this war, wherein he had been obliged to fly from pro-
vince to province, he went over to Spain, where he had an interview
with Scipio, afterwards called A fricanws, and declared for the Romans.
To this honourable alliance he ever after adhered with the utmost zeal
and constancy. When Laelius arrived in Africa, Masinissa joined him
with a few horse3 his misfortunes would not permit him to bring great
succours to that general. Soon after this, a great battle was fought,
wherein Syphax was defeated, taken prisoner by Laelius and Masinissa,
brought in chains to Scipio, carried afterwards to Rome, made to adom
the triumph, and was then clapt in prison, and starved to death for
