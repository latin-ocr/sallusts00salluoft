SALLUSTII CATILINA. 6 1

nit. Tum M. Tullius Consul, sive praesentiam ejus ti-
mens‚⁵ seu ira commotus, orationem habuit luculentam

atque utilem reipublicae: quam postea scriptam edidit.
Sed ubi ille adsedit, Catilina, ut erat paratus ad dissi-
mulanda omnia, demisso voltu, voce supplici postulare,
“ Patres conscripti6 ne quid de se temere crederent ; ea
familia ortum, ita ab adolescentia vitam instituisse, ut7

glum levior res est. Siquidem inter benevolos aut propinquos dissentio
vel concertatio, juryium dicitur: Inter inimicos dissensio Lis appella-
tur. M. Tullius de Republica, lib. 4, Si juryant, inquit, Benevolorum
concertatio juryium, Lis inimicorum dicitur. See also Popma’s work
on “ Latin Synonymes‚” a large edition of which, with notes, 1 have
ready for the press. Juryia signifies menaces in Virg. AEn. 11, v. 406.
Mair renders it defamation. It is here in the sense of convitio. See
Ciofanius, on Ovid's Metamorph., lib. 3, p. 63.—C.

⁴ In senatum venia] Sed nemo eum appellavit, nemo salutavit, et
subselliorum partem, ad quam ille accesserat, nudam senatores reli-
querant.—Cic. ii. Cat. cap. 6.—-M.

⁵ Praesentz’am ejus timens] As not thinking himself absolutely se-
cured against Catiline’s plots, even when in the senate—M.

⁶ Patres conscripti] Romulus, soon after the building of Rome,
chose out of the graver and more elderly citizens one hundred persons,
to assist him in the administration. These made up his senate, and
were, by a solemn appellation, called PATREs‚ as Sallust informs us,
cap. vi. But after an alliance was entered into with Tatius, and the
Sabines came and settled in Rome, Romulus enlarged the senate by
adding another hundred to it. And this last hundred, as being co-
elected, and superadded to, or put in joint commission with the for-
mer, were properly called PATRES coxscnrr‘n. But the appellation
came in a short time to be common, and was given to all the senators
without distinetiom who, in the senate, were constantly addressed
under this honourable title.-M.

⁷ Εα familia ortum, ita ab adolescentia vitam instituisse, ut, &c.]
Ea is here for tali. So Liv. lib. 3, e. 53, Ea postulavit, ut appareret,
8ιο- Ib. c. 61, Nolle ominari, quae nec Jupiter, nec Mars pater pas-
