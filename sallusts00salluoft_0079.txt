SALLUSTII CATILINA. 67

scientia de culpa³ proponere decrevi, quam me Dius-
fidius‘ veram licet cognoscas. Injuriis contumeliisque
concitatus quod fructu laboris industriaeque meae priva-
tus, statum dignitatis non obtinebam, publicam misero-

new measures Ι have taken ; the words of Sallust cannot bear this
sense ; that would be ob novum consilium, or something quite different
from what we have here. I intended to say nothing more on this sen-
tence, but- having looked at Anthon's note, Ι must make a remark.
He renders it, “ Wherefore, as regards the novel step which I have
taken, Ι have resolved not to prepare a formal defence of it against my
enemies, but without any consciousness of misconduct, have deter-
mined to lay before you such an explanation as may remove the doubts
of a friend.’⁷ Kritzius has not mentioned the interpretation of Casti-
lioneus, nor the translation of Alfieri: Novum consilium, says he, non
cum Gerlachio inteUigo de conjuratione inita, sed de ffectione ad
Manlii exercitum, διο. The preposition z'n is precisely the same as de,
01· quod attinet ad very frequently, as in all the examples given by
Mair, on chap. 9, to which I might add Ov. de Art. Amand. Pallidus
in Lyrice silvis errabat Orion. Pallidus in lenta Naide Daphnis erat.
Metam. 7, 22, Quid z'n hospite, regia virgo, ureris? and 8, 50, Merito
Deus arsit in illa. Id. Amor. 2, 8, 9, Quid? quod in ancilla si quis
delinquere posset, &c. Ter. Andr. 1, 4, 6, Di, date illi in aliis potius
peccandi locum. Cic. Off. 2, 18, 3, In iis tamen qui se adjuvari vo-
lent, restricti omnino esse nullo modo debemus, where see Heffising.
and Oudendorp. on Caes. de B. Gall. 2, 32, 2 ; and Pearce on Cic. Off.
But I shall end the dispute by demanding a proof of in used in the
sense of de, or quod attinet ad, before an inanimate object. Let one
be produced, and I shall admit that it may have that meaning here,
but not before. It is used for de, or quod attinet ad, in Jug. c. 73,
In utroque magis studia partium, &c.—C.

³ Ex nulla conscientia de culpa] Propter conscientiam de nulla
culpa sive inde quod mihi nullius culpae sim conscius. Ex pro per
et propter ponitur.—M.

⁴ Dius-fidius] Dius is the same as Deus, and Dius-fidius the same
as Deus-fidei, the god of honour, i. e. Hercules. The phrase imports
Ita me Diusfidiusjuvet.-ll1.
