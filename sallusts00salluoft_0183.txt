most glaring3 e. 9., one translator renders ὄψει, thou skalt see, in
a verse of the Supplices of Euripides (Ι do not know the line, having
lent the work to a friend a few days ago) ; whereas, it is the dative case
of ὄψις. Even Gibbon, whom some persons call a prodigy of learning,
has rendered a passage in the works of St. Jerome very badly. See a
Popular Histoi-y of Ireland‚ by Captain Rock (that is, ΜΓ. Thomas
Moore, a man comparable to none for omnigenous erudition), No Ι. p.
4. The incomparable author says, Diodorus Siculus, without any qua-
lification, assei-ts, that they (i. e. ancient Irish) were anthropophagi,
and some modern authors have appealed to St. J emme, in support of
the charge. And in a note he says: Gibbon (Decline and Fall, vol. ii.
p. 531), was the first who noticed the passage in St. J erome. It runs
thus, Quid loquor de caeteris nationibus, quum ipse adolescentulus in
Gallia viderim Attacottos, gentem Britannicam, humanis vesci carni-
bus3 et quum per silvas porcorum greges et armentorum pecudumque
reperiunt, pastorum nates et feminarum papillas solere abscindere, et
has solas ciborum delicias arbitrari? (S. Hieron. 4, p. 201 3 advers.
Jovin. lib. 2). Gibbon translates it thus: “They curiously selected
the most delicate and brawny parts of both males and females, which
they prepared for their horrid repasts.'⁷ The real meaning of the pas-
sage, however, is: “When the Attacotti, wandel-ing in the woods,
meet with flocks and herds of black cattle, sheep, and pigs, they are in
the habit of cutting off the rumps of the fat beasts, and the udders of
the OOWS, swine, and ewes, consider-ing these as the only delicate parts
of the animals.'' St. Jerome, though he accuses an individual (pro-
bably some person exhibited as a prodigy) of cannibalism, acquits the
tribe of the practice. See Dr. Parr’s Review of Combe’s Variorum
Horaees in the “ British Critic” of 1794 ς “ Classical Journal'' of 1812 ;
Grough's Camden, vol. i. p. 99. Thus far the Irish Coryphaeus ‘of

glaring mistakes, committed by another champion of infidelity, Mons.
