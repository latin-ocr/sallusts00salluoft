SALLUSTII J UGURTHINUM. 187

vicit tamen impudentia. Ita populus ludibrio habitus
ex concione discessit: Jugurthae Bestiaeque, et caeteris,
quos illa quaestio exagitabat, animi augescunt.

very phrase, “Ex Graeco vero translata vel Sallustii plurima, quale
est, Vulgus amat fieri.'⁷ Compare Hor. Carm. 3, 16, 9, “Aurum per
medios ire satellites. Et perrumpere amat saxa.” He gives the trans·
lation of Francis, as poor Anthon could do nothing without transla—
tions. Vechner, in his Hellenolex, giving examples of amare for so-
lere, has not noticed this of Sallust 3 and very properly, because there
is no Hellenism or Greek idiom here. I saw the gross error of Fabius
thirty years ago, when Ι was admodum adolescens; and Ι have seen it
this day from a note of the most learned Gataker‚ on Marc. Antonin.
lib 10, p. 369. ἱ After speaking of φιλεῖ for solet, he says, Quanquam
diversum est paulo Sallustianum illud, quod ibi Fabius adduxit3 Vul-
9us amat fieri. Sicut et ejusdem illud, in Jug. Quae ira fieri amat.
et ib. rursus; ea quae secundae res amant. In istis enim sensus est,
quae amant, i. e. quae cupiunt et quibus delectantur, vel, quae libenter

vel„ vulqus-fieri solet ; sed per iram ; et vulgo, vel a vulgo, dixeris.
Quod vin's magnis non est animadversum. He then quotes the sen-
tence above from Hor. and many more from Herodot. Plat. Polyb.
and Herodian„ who uses {gq'i in the sense of solet, lib. 1, and Ammian.
Marcell. Tacit. and Apul. too long for transcription. Ι am astonished
that Quintilian did not see the absurdity of making amat, solet in the
sentence, quoe ira fieri amat, and the others. “ Which anger is accus-
tomed to be done ;” surely this is rank nonsense. By why wonder at
the hallucinations of great men, when Horace sayS, “ Quandoque bo-
nus dormitat Homerus ;” and “ Humanum est errare, labi, falli, de-
cipi ?” Is it possible that Boyd, who has access to a great university
library, has not corrected Anthon and Fabius here? Me miserum! Ι
am permitted to inspect any book in Trinity College ς but Ι do not like
to be troublesome to my learned friend (Ι hope he will allow me the
use of that appellation), the librarian 3 and, therefore, I have never, as
yet, extracted or transcribed a note from any work in the library. Ι,
unfortunately, am left to my own resources3 I have no assistant. Ι
pardon Anthon here, as much more learned men have overlooked the
