SALLUSTII J UGURTHINL'M. 21 1

L. Sed ubi Numidas quietos, neque colle degredi ani·
madvorfit, veritus, ex anni tempore, et inopia aquae, ne
siti conficeretur exercitus, Rutilium legatum, cum expe-
ditis cohortibus et parte equitum praemisit ad flumen, uti
locum castris antecaperet ε existumans, hostis crebro im-

petu et transvorsis praeliis iter suum remoraturos, et,
quoniam armis diffiderent, lassitudinem et sitim militum
tentaturos.¹ Dein ipse pro re atque loco, sicuti monte
descenderat, paullatim procedere: Marium post princi-

L. ¹ Las2itudinem et sitim militum tentaturos] Tentaturos, ut las-
situdine et siti deficeret exercitus-M.

¹ Marium post principia haberem] Sallust speaks here in bernis ac-
commodated not to an army on a march, but to one drawn up in battle-
order. The meaning is, that the station assigned to Marius was in
neither of the wings3 or to speak in terms adapted to a march, neither
