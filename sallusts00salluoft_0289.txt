SALLUSTII J UGURTHIN ΠΜ. 2 75

dum Thalam magna gloria ceperat, hand dissimiliter si-
tum munitumque: nisi quod apud Thalam haud longe a
moenibus aliquot fontes erant ; Capsenses una modo at-
que ea intra oppidum, jugi aqua, caetera pluvia utebantur.
Id ibique, et in omni Africa, qui,3 procul a mari incul-

3 In omni A fricc‘z', qui.] Sallust often moulds his relatives and ad-
jectives according to the sense, without minding gender and number of
antecedents and substantives: cap. 16, Vicit tamen in senatu illa pars,
qui vero pretium aut gratiam anteferebant. Cap. 58, Magna pars vol-
nerati, aut occisi. See Cat. cap. 5, note 2.—M.

In omni A fricti, qui procul, &c.] Anthon reads ayebat, and has the
following note. Cortius reads qui and ayebant, comparing the use of
the masculine form, qui, after Africa, to the construction pars qui, so
common in Sallust. Our reading is that of the Bipont edition, and
appears decidedly preferable. As Africa, in this passage, denotes the
inhabitants of the country, there is little, if any, harshness in reading
quae—ayebat, scil. se. Reader, do you not think that the writer of
this note was captus mente? He says that, as Africa here denotes
the inhabitants of the country, there is little, if any, harskness in read·
ing quae—aqebat. If Africa denotes the inhabitants of the country, Ι
think that an excellent reason for reading qui and ayebant with Cortius.
See also J ug, last chapter, note 2, of Mair. Sui-ely there can be no
harskness in readiny anything. The harshness is in the words, not
the readiny. He says se is understood after aqebat ; I deny it. This
reciprocal pronoun is often understood, aS, prora avertit, in Virgil, but
not after ayere. It is vitam or aetatem, or tempus. Sanctius says, at
the ellipsis of vitam, In ayere, et perayere, et tractare, saepe deest vi-
tam vel <etatem ; quod notius est, quam ut indicari conveniat. Hor.
Vitamque sub dio, et trepidis ayat in rebus. I am sorry that I am so
often compelled to consume precious time in correcting the errors of the
American professor. Boyd is silent here again3 and, Ι believe, every-
where. A word more on Africa, qui. Jan. Rutgersius, in his Var.
Lection., lib. 4, c. 14, p. 427, cites Juvenal, who has—

“ Dilexit Thebas, si Graecia vera, Monaecus,
In quorum sulcis,’' &c.

Graecia quorum, figura est quam ἀλλοιότητα Graeci vocant. 1 have
