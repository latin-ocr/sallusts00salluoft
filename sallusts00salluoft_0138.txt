observed. Liv. also, as Fabius has observed, Book 9th, commences
his history by the beginning of an hexameter, Facturusne operae pre-
tium. The same Liv. Book 30, Legati ab Carthagine, paucis ante
dicbus. See Vossius, in his Institut. Orat. Book 4, c. 4, ξ 3, p. 72.
who adduces this part of an hexameter from Sallust, Jamque dies con-
sumptus erat. And from Caesar, about the Gall. lVar, Book 1, Pau-
cisque dejectis reliquos sese convertere cogunt And from Corn. Nepos,
in the beginning of his Lives, Nos in Graiorum virtutibus exponendis3
and from Cic. in the first of those epistles to Lentulus, His ego consi—
liis si te praesentem habuissem3 aud Book 11, Epist. 8, to Caelius
Rufus, Quare da te homiui3 complectetur, mihi crede3 and to Atticus,
Epist. 18, Book 11, Displiceo mihi, nec sine summo scribo dolore.
Vossius produces a great variety, and cites a great number of crines,
that treat of the same subject z as Barthius, in his Adversaria, Book
8, c. 21, and Book ll, c. 163 Quintillian, in his Inst. Orat. Book 9,
c. 4, says, Versum in oratione ficri, multo foedissimum est, totum: si-
cut etiam in parte, difforme. Markland observes in his Epist. Crit. p.
14, that Fabius himself fell into the same negligence of composition,
that he so sharply censures in others. W'e should use, says Quintil-
llan, Inst. Orat. Book 1, c. G, Plane sermone, ut nummo, cui publica
forma est. Here is a line in verse, if you wish for more, consult
Bircovius at Dionys. Halicarn. vol. 2, p. 51, v. 39, edit. of Oxford.
See the Apostle JameS, i. 17, where Blackwall, in his Classic. Sacr. p.
151, observes, there is an entire hexameter. See also Hutchinson, at
Xenoph. Κυςοπ. last book, p. 448, at these words, which constitute a
verse, ψελλια καὶ cresum-01, καὶ ἵπποι χρυσοχάλινοι, from whom 1 have
taken the last part of this note. Upton, on Dionys. Halicarn. de
Structnra Orat. ξ 15, p. ⁵231, adduces from Demosthen. pro Ctesiph.
Τὶὖν ozaziu Ἑλλήνων πολλακις ἒστεφοινωσέαι; and from Dionys. in the
commem-emeat of the work de Strnct. ὦξαν, καὶ γαμετῆς χαριν west-nv·
ἀλλὰ ποιημὰζ and from St· chrysostom de SacerdotiQ Τοῦ καπνοῦ
argon-‘plage καὶ κμαυςωσεν ἅπασαν, which last verse is worthy of re-
mark, he says, as it terminates a period. He cites the distich above
from Cic. de Orat. Complexi, plus, δια, using the same language
