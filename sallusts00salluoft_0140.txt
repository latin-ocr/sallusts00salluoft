1 28 SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM.

1. c. and Virg. AEn. 12, 88, and Mair's note on Jug. c. 623 and also
the note of Rupertus. The New York professor has, Ι see, written
notes on the AEn. of Virgil, which a Mr. Major, an Englishman, has
published with his permission. O, Britannia, once famed for your
Markland, your Bentley, your Musgrave, your Toup, your Porson,
your Burney, &c., has one of your degenerate sons dishonoured and
disgraced you thus? What! to ask Anthon's permission to publish
his notes on Virgil in England! Oh, Major! you ought to be
ashamed.—C.

⁴ Post maynitudinem nominis Romani] Since the Romans came to
be great, and make a figure in the world3 for, during their infant state
they had met with as great, nay greater calamities, particularly from
the Gauls, who burned Rome—M.

⁵ In amicitiam receptus] Not amicitia, as Cor-tius, Muellerus, Lan-
gius, Faber, &c., have it, which would be bad Latin, says Kritzius;
for we cannot say in rure or ayriS, abire, or in conspectu alicujus ve-
nire, or rem in potestate alicujus committere, or in diversorio admit-
tere, or in hostibus proficisci. In diversorio admittere is sometimes
good3 as, Petronius, c. 19, Veteri in hoc diversorio quenquam ad-
mitti ; but observo, continues Kritzius, that this is spoken with ref'e-
rence to those who were in diversorio, not to those wishing to be ad-
mitted into it. Similarly recipere is frequently joined with the prepo-
sition in, and an ablative3 as Ov. Heroid. 6, 20, In mihi promissi
parte recepta tori3 and Metam. 11, 229, Sideraque in coelo recepta.
But there is here no motion. This is the usual construction of recipi,
when there is only the notion of a place, in which any thing is re-
ceived. He admits that he has a host of commentators and critics
against him, as Wasse, on Sallust, Catil. c. 19 ; Cortius on Catil. 423
Thomas Linacer, 6, p. 6313 Vossius de construet. c. 55; Ruddiman.
