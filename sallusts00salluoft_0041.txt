SALLUSTII CATILINA. 29

manu, ventre, pene, bona patria laceraverat3 quique
alienum aes grande conflaverat, quo flagitium, aut facinus
redimeret; praeterea, omnes undique parricidae, sacri-
legi, convicti judiciis, aut pro factis judicium timentes3

1, 9, and 4, 12. Scelus is everywhere in Terence for scelestus ; and
servitia for servi, in Sallust. I could cite a multiplicity of other
erities that have adduced similar sentences, in which the abstract is
used for the conerete3 as the commentators on the New Testament,
and others. See Rom. xi. 7, election for elect. Scioppius, in his notes
on the Carmina Principefa‚ e. y. Carm. 36, Vulcan is called Tutela
Lemni for tut0r3 and 76, Carm., Tutela Rhodos, pro ρο, says Sciop-
pius, Qm· est sub tutela; and Carm. 73, Pomarii tutela diligens, for
tutor. Virgil, AEn. 2, v. 65, . . . Crimine ab uno, that is, criminoso
homine. Beneath, ehap. 20, Neque ego per ignaviam, aut vana in-
genia, incerta pro certis, &c., by means of men of inactive and fickle
tempers 3 or, by means of cowardly or irresolute associates, as a Scotch-
man, called Dymock, renders it. But the reading should be, in my
opinion, Per ignava, ὅτε. So in French, Ia noblesse, and in EngHsh,
the nobility, for nobles ; so likewise yentry. Servitia for servL—Liv.
4, c. 12, 30, and 45. Ultima vitia, for ultimi vitiosi, ἰ. e., maxime
vitiosi.-Juvenal, Sat. 2, v. 34. Custodia for custodibus.—-Virgil,
AEn. 9, v. 166. See La Cerda. Conjugium, for conjugem, husband.
Virg. AEn. 2, v. 579. ὅμηλικιαι for &mame-Hom. IL, 5, v, 3263
so, acquaintance, for a person with whom we converse or correspond.
Civitas for cives.-Liv. 5, 39. In a similar manner, Juvenal, Sat. 12,
v. 24, Quem mire afficiunt inscripta ergastula, carcer Rusticus, Sco..
where the res is used for the persona. So Euripid. in Supplic. v. 7—1,
ξυναλγηόονες for ξυναλγοῢσαι, res pro persona, as the most learned
Markland observes at the word. Id. ib. v. 173, aegeoesswpeoev', where the
same commentator says, Res seu actio, pro persona, quasi diceres, ἀι
πρέσβεις, legatae. Centies occurrit. Remigium for remiges—Virg.
AEn. 3, 471. γεςὰς, an old man—Hom. Il. 17, 197. Scelus, for
scelestus occurs also in Virg. AEn. 11, v. 407. Artificis scelus, for
scelestus artifex3 and conjugium for conjux, a wife—lb. v. 269. Ig-
naviam for ignavos, beneath, chap. 20, inactive or cowardlyassociates.
Βουλευτήςιον is used for a consultor or senator, ‘by Eurip. in Andr. v.
