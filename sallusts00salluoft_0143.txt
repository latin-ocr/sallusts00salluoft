Pythoni rhetori, ferocienti et multo fluenti adversus vos minime cessi.
Ita Graeci alibi Λαβρός ῥεων, λαβξὸς ἒπαιγίζων3 et adjectivum hic om-
nino elegantius est adverbio. He then quotes Virg. Georg. 3, 28, and
John Toup, in a note on the passage of Demosth. de Coron.‚ adduoed
by Bentley, says, Locutio est Graecis usitata πολυς ῥεων, ut habet Phi-
lostratus Praefat. ad vit. Sophist. et Pollux, 4, ξ 21. Vel πολλῳ ῥέων,
ut idem Pollux, 6, 147- Multum is taken adverbially in the sense of
affatim, or ubertim, in Vir-g, Et multum lacrymas verba inter singula
fundit, as the learned Broukhusius has observed in his comments on
Propertius. See a host of adjectives used adverbially in Vechner's
Hellenolex, lib. 1, p. 129, as, Hor. 2, Od. 19, 6, Plenoque Bacchi pec-
tore turbidum laetatur3 Mart. 2, 263 Stat. Silv. 5, 1, Neo frons triste
rigens3 Virg. 7 AEn., 399, Torvumque repente clamat3 Hor. 2, Ep.
2, 9, Quin etiam canet indoctum, sed dulce bibenti. Id. 1 Sat. 8,
Umbrae cum Sagana resonarent ttiste et acutum3 Id. 2 Od. 12, Me
voluit dicere lucidum fulyentes oculos3 Virg. 6 AEn. v. 50, Nec mor-
tale sonans3 Stat. 3, Theb. v. 225, Vacua jacet hostis arena turpe ge-
mens. Sed Jam satis—C.

⁴ Imperii vitaeque ejus finis idem fuit] Some have taken these
words to import only that Masinissa continued to be King of Numidia
till his death3 but this sense is trifiing. The true meaning is, that the
grant of the dominions made to him by the Romans was only during
his own life, and did not descend to his son. Accordingly we find that
Micipsa had only that part of Numidia which anciently belonged to
his father3 but Cirta, and the other parts of Numidia which had been
taken from Syphax, were, upon the death of Masinissa, reduced by the
Romans into the form of a province—M.

⁵ Micipsa filiu-su] Masinissa had forty-rfom· sons, or, as some say,
fifty-four, of whom three only were legitimate. His family, as far as
taken notice of by Sallust, may be thus represented :—

The sons of Masinissa were-
