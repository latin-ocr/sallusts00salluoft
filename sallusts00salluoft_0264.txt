Cat. 30, 3, p. 137, Ut absolute posita vi emundationis secundariae, re-
lativo et esse explendae, ad nomen accuratius definiendum pertinerent,
eundem etiam in his structuris obtinere certum est. Cf. Catull. 4, 11,
Ubi iste post phaselus ante fuit comata silva, i. e, qui postea fuit, seu
postea factus. Plaut. Amphitr. 11, 2, 138, Tu intus pateram proferto
foras, ἰ. e. quae intus est, pateram prof. for. Id. Perz. 3, 1, 57, Non
tu nunc hominum mores vides, i. e. qui nunc sunt. But he admits
that Herzog. on Caes. B. G. 5, 54, is against him, and so is Donatus,
as you perceive. It appears to me that ante, in the passage under
consideration, which Ι can call an adverb with as much propriety as
he calls circum and circa, posita cum substantivo (Ι use his own
words) in unam notionem conflari videtur. I would call all the ex-
amples cited by Kritzius, and by Vechner in his Hellenolex. pp. 143,
144, Grecisms as Vechner does. Vossius, in his Institut. Orat. lib. 5,
c. 4, p. 317, calls the figure Synthesis, ὑφ’ ἕν, also συμπλοκῇ, and
quotes, heri semper—lenitas of Ter. and Lucret. lib. 1, Unde sibi ex-
ortam semperflorentis Homeri, &c. 3 hoc est, ἀειθαλοῦς, and Ovid's imi-
tation, 7, Metam. fab. 26, Vertice de summo semperflorentis Hymetti.
Ptopertii etiam sunt, semper-amicitia, semper-furor, semper-cupidus,
pluraque id genus, Ovidii 4, Fast. Semper-parens. Senecae in Hip-
polyto est, semper-fluentes caminos : uti in Hercule Furente, semper-
alienum J ovem: in Thebaide, semper-cruente. See more in Voss. and
Andr. Schott. Observat. lib. 2, c. 42, and lib. 1, c. 9, and Huet's notes
on Antholog., p. 26, c. 23. All these great men are against Kritzius.
Ι am sorry I must stop : this note is already too long—C.

⁵ Arietibus feriri] The ram, says Josephus, was a vast long beam,
like the mast of a ship, strengthened at one end with a head of iron,
somewhat resembling that of a ram, whence it took its name. This
was hung by the middle with ropes fastened to a beam that lay across
a couple of posts, and hang-Ing thus equally balanced, it was by a great
number of men violently thrust forward, drawn back, and again pushed
forward, till, by reiterated strokes, it had shaken and broke down the
wall with its iron head. N.B.—The ram was commonly covered with

vineae, to protect both it and the men from the attempts of the enemy.
