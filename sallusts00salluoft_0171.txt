⁹ Africae pars inferior pleraque] The lower part of any country,
that borders on the sea, is the coast or shore, as is evident from the
course of rix-<2133 and, therefore, by pars inferior here we are to under-

For pleraque, see cap. 54, note 4.-Μ,

eastern coast of the Mediterranean.—M.

⁸ Alii multitudinis—pars imperii] Another author would have said

situated betwix't Hadrumetum and Thapsus3 for Leptis major lay be-
twixt the Syrtes, as he tells us in this very chapter.--M.

his wealth, fied from Tyre, came by shipping into Africa, and founded
this city. It was built about one hundred years before Rome, was a
great and floun'shing city, and for a long time the rival of Rome ς till
at last, about the year of Rome, 608, it was entirely destroyed and re—
duced to ashes by Scipio. The buming continued for seventeen days
together3 it was said to have been twenty-four miles in compass—-BL
