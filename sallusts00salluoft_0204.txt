cess before a court, which consisted of several parts; such as', 1. The
summoning or citing the offending person to the court at the instance
of the actor or plaintiff3 and this they called in jus vocare. 2. The
accusatio, or impeaching of him before the judges. After this a day
was appointed for the tria13 and then came on, 3. The defensio, or ex-
culpation offered by the reus, or accused person, for his own vindica-
tion. 4. The disceptatio causae, or pleading of the lawyers on both
sides. 5. The latio sententiae, for pronouncing of sentence. See Ken-

in a former process, but in the former part of this proeess3 as the
phrase in summa arbore does not signify upon a very high tree, bnt
upon the top or highest part of the tree. See cap. 107, note 1.--M.

⁹ Vades dederat] These vades were snreties or cautionem, who, at

he should appear and answer at his tn‘aL—M.
