want of food, as a just reward of his treachery. Masinissa, the victor,
besieged Cirta, his capital, and took it: but he met with a greater dan-
ger in that city than he had faced in the field 3 and this was Sophonisba,
whose charms he was unable to resist, and therefore forthwith married
her, but, a few days after, was obliged to send her a dose of poison as
her nuptial present, this being the only way left him to keep his pro-
mise with his queen, viz„ not to deliver her up to the Romans, and to
satisfy Scipio, who was highly displeased with the marriage. Sopho—
nisba swallowed the deadly dose, and expired. After the second Punic
war, Masinissa was favoured till his death with an uninterrupted series
of prosperity. Scipio, as a reward of his good services, not only re-
stored him his own kingdom, but added to it, during his life, that of
Syphax, his enemy, so that he became the most powerful prince in all
Africa, his dominions extending from Mauritania as far as Cyrene. He
was blessed with the greatest health and vigour of constitution, and
lived to upwards of ninety years of age. He died about a year before
the destruction of Carthage 3 and much about the same time died at
Rome, Cato, the renowned moralist. See the life of this prince more
at large in Rollin's history of the Carthaginians.—M.

'¹ Cujus in Africa maynum atque latex imperium valacia] Vid. Pe-
rizon. ad Sanct. 1, 17, note 1. As this consummate scholar has said
so very little on this sentence, which appears very perplexing to all
young students, I should endeavour to remove the difficulty, which
consists in the word maynum. This is an adverb, or, at least, to be
taken as such, and not as an adjective ; so μεγαι for μεγαλως is com-
mon in Greek.—Virg. Georg. 3, 28. Atque hic undantem bello mag-
numque fluentem Nilum, &c.—Tacit. Ann. 6, c. 37. Nunciavere ac-
colae Euphratem sponte et immensum attolli.—1d. Ann. 4, c. 60. Ti-
beriussalsum renitens vultu.—Aul. Gell. 5, c. 9. Repente maynum
inclamavit. Multo is also used adverbially, after the imitation of the
Greeks, in Hor. lib. 1, Sat. 1, v. 28, Tum Proenestinus salso multoque
fluenti, &c. 3 where the most learned Bentley says, Multo fluenti,
ςηλλᾷἷ ῥέοντι, ut ait Demosthenes, cujus profecto locum in animo ha-
