people in the Capitol, and call over as many days as there were be-
tween that and the nones3 and so from the old verb calo, derived from
the Greek καλῶ, to call, the first day of the mouth had the name of
kalendae. But this custom continued only till the year of Rome, 450,
when Cn. Flavius, the curule aedile, ordered the fasti, or kalendar, to
be fixed up in public places, that every body might know the times,
and the return of the festivals.

The nonae were so called, because, reckoning inclusively, there are
nine days from them to the ides.

The ides fell near about the middle of the mouth ς and the word is
derived from iduare, an obsolete verb, borrowed from the Etrurian lan-
guage‚ which signifies to divide.

The Greeks had no kalends in their way of reckoning 3 and hence
the Latin proverb, ad kalendas Graecas, is used to signify a time that
never will happen: particularly Augustus, when speaking of desperate
debtors, used, in a facetious manner, to say, ad kalendas Graecas solu-
turos, as we learn from Sueton.—Aug. cap. 87.

to assert, as it were unanimously, that all the names of the months are
used adj ectively, except Aprilis. Is it possible that these learned men
could have overlooked Cic. 2, Philip. c. 16, Ο praeclaram illam percur-
sationem tuam mense Aprili atque Maio, tum, διε. 3 and same, Philip.
c. 37, Quonam modo ante kalendas Apriles debere desisti ? And Qui
dies mensem findit Aprilem, in Hor. cited by Sanctius, in his Minerva,
lib. 4, c. 4, p. 603, at the ellipsis os mensis ⁴? Nonis Aprilibus is in Cicero,
Ι forget where. Usque in decimum kalendarum Aprilium.—-Columel.
