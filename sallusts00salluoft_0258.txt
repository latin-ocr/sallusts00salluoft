244 SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM.

alteri generis humilitas favorem addiderat3 caeterfim in
utroque magis studia partium‚³ quam bona aut mala sua

well versed in Greek as he was in Latin, he would not have made these
words the dative3 they are clearly in the ablative, signifying cupide,
or lubenter, or animo qui ista vellet. The structure is quite different
from c. 84, Quia neque plebi, &c.—C.

³ Caeterum in utroque mayis studia partium, &c.] This is one of
the most difficult and embarrassing passages in our author 3 and it will,
therefore, require a long note. First, in utroque is de utroque, respectu
utriusque viri, quod attinet ad utrumque, (see my note ou Catil. c. 35),
bona aut mala, never can signify the virtues or vices of persons, but
prosperity or adversity—prosperous, or adverse affairs and condition.
There is not one word correct in the interpretation of eortius, which is
this: Magis ex studiis partium Metellum invidia, Marium favor seque-
batur, quam ex bonis virtutibus aut vitiis eorum.—Kritz. Studia,
mala, and bona, have been taken by all the editors before Kritzius, sor
the subject or nominative to moderata (scil. sunt) which the pronoun
sua proves cannot be so. Kritzius reads moderabant, having plebes
for its subject. as it is the subject to acceperant, and bona aut mala
sua belong to plebes. Moderare, adds Kritzius, quo sensu dictum sit,
facile ὲ primaria verbi potestate cognoscitur. Nam moderare vel mo-
derari aliquid, significat aliquid instituere ac regere ς quae autem regi-
mus, iis sumus intenti, ea spectamus et curamus· Quare totius loci
sensus hic est z in utroque (i. e. respectu utriusque viri, cf. ad Catil.
51, 35, p. 256), magis intenti erant (plebs) in studia partium quam
in bona aut mala sua, sive, magis quaerebant, quomodo adversam in
civitate partem affligerent, quam quomodo sibi ipsis prospicerent. This
appears to me a satisfactory reading, and also explanation of this very
obscure sentence; yet his interpretation of moderare, or moderari, is
not, in my mind, very correct. DIodero, same as moderor, is used by
Pacuvius, Accius, and Plautus, (see F acciolati), and will apply to stu-
dia partium very well; and, perhaps, to bona aut mala sua .- however,
I would prefer procurabant, in Greek, ἔκηδουνς and 1 think this is the
verb iu the text of a very old edition sent to me from Rome3 certainly
curabant is quite legible, but an abbreviation before it, which, I be-
lieve, always stands for per or pro is not very legible. In my humble
opinion, the explanation of Kritzius is much more applicable to procus
