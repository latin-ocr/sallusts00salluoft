SALLUSTII CATILINA. 4⁹

homini non minor vanitas, quam audacia 3³ neque reti-
cere, quae audierat, neque suamet ipse* scelera occultare.
prorsus neque dicere, neque facere quidquam pensi ha-

which was done by striking his name out of the rolls. The equites
they punished by taking away the horse allowed them at the public

charge. The commons they might either remove firom a higher tribe
to a less honourable, or quite disable them to give their votes iu the
assemblies, by erasing their name out of the album, i. e. the register
or roll belonging to their century. These several ways of punishing
were shortly expressed in Latin thus, Senatu ejicere, equum adimere,
trilmre movere in Caerit-um tabulas referre. The Caerites were the
people of Caere, a town in Etruria, who, for their good services to the
Romans in the Gallie war, were honoured with the froedom of the
city, but without the right of voting at the elections. And when any
citizen was deprived of his right of voting by the Censors, his name
as it was struck out of the rolls οῖ’ his own century, so it was entered
in the tabulae or register of the Caerites. Hence too the proverb
Caerite caera digni—Hor. Ι. Epist. vi. ver. 62, of those that daeerve
to be censured and lose their privilege—M.

The Censors, after the quinquennia] survey, made an expiatory
sacrifice in a very solemn manner, in the name of all the people. It
consisted of a sow, a sheep, and a bull, whence it got the name of
suove-taurina. This ceremony they called lustrum condere, and hence
lustrum came to signi& the space of five years—M.

' Quem Censores senatu probri yratid moverant] N ot amoverant,
which is the reading of many editions. λίουετε senatu, and not αηιο-
vere is the formula, See Brissonius de Formul. p. 254.-C.

³ Huic homini non minor vanitas qudm audacia] Afber vanitas,
Kritzius has inerat—C·

⁴ Suamet ipsa] This is good Latin ; but suamet ipsa, which many
copies have, is not3 as ipse always depends on the verb, or is the sub-
ject of it, and does not agree with the possessive pronoun. The syl-
lable met is never joined to demonstrative pronouns; 1, therefore, am

quite surprised that a most learned German, Antony Goerenz, should
have introduced illumet into the text of Cic. de Legibus, i. 1, from the
conjecture of Adrian Turnebus-C.
