owns) to all the best manuscripts, substituted his conjectura] emenda-
tion, sibi quique : yet he himself adduces a similar passage from Dictys
Cretensis, 3, 4, Ascensis curribus bellum ineunt, ascito sibi quisque
auriga ad regendos equos3 and another, from Justin‚ 29, 1, His reqi—
bus pueris—in suorum quisque maJ‘orum vestiyia nitentibus, mayna in-
doles virtutis enituit. In the former passage, indeed, eortius attempts
to account for the nominative quisque, by referring it to the verb,
ineunt-3 and in the latter, he considers quisque as quisque, or quibus-
que3 thus, Ι think, making no very classical Latin of it, though, per-
haps, good enough for J ustin. I am really much more disposed, in all
these instances, to consider the expression as elliptica13 e. 9., Multis im-
perium petentibus, ita ut sibi quisque peteret. Thus far my learned
friend. Having consulted h'un by letter, on this same subject, I pro-
duced this sentence from Plaut. in Rudent: Cistellam istic inesse oportet
caudeam in isto vidulo Ubi sunt signa, qu3 parentes noscere haec pos-
sit suos, &c., which seems to make for Cortius; he answered me by re-
turn of post, promising to consult a good edition of Plaut„ as soon as
he could, and to send me the result of his investigation3 but, alas!
“superas migravit ad auras, hoc mundo spreto deliciisque vaais,” with-
out writing another letter. Kritzius has a very long note on quisque,
which is his reading also. Kritzius says that he has taken his note
from Lechner, who agrees with Walker in making quisque the nomi-
native. Livy has even used it with the ablative absolute of passive
participles, lib. 21, 49, 9, Tum vero omnes, velut Diis auctoribus, in
spem suam quisque acceptis, id morae, διο. Kritzius says Ubi prono-
men non alio modo, nisi sententia in activum mutata, excusari potest.
Livii menti autem observabatur: quos quisque in spem suam acceperat.
Kritzius observes that Langius, Muellerus, and Gerlachius are in error,
by thinking that quisque is for quibusque ; inconsulto (says he) quam
ablativi formam qui relativum habet ad quisque transferentes, neque
reputantes nunquam pluralis numen· substantivo pluralem quisque pro-
nominis per appositionem addi. ΤΙιεῐι, after quoting J ug. 57, Romani
pro ingenio quisque pars eminus pugnare; and c. 58, At nostri sibi
quisque pro moribus consulunt, δια, he sayS, Consimili, sed liberiore
modo imbueras vidit mad quisque etiam ablativis absolutis inteme-
