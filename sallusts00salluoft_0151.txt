SALLUSTII J UGURTHINUM. 139

aedis irrupere, diversi regem quaerere : dormientis alios,
alios occursantis interficere3 scrutari loca abdita 3 clausa
effringere ; strepitu et tumultu omnia miscere : eum
Hiempsal interim reperitur, occultans se in tugurio² mu-
lieris ancillae,3 quo initio pavidus et ignarus loci perfuge-

⁸ occultans sein tuffam-ia] Ι have taken the liberty to alter the
text of Cortius, for good reasons. F irst. Ι find the reading of this sen-
tence to be in one of the oldest editions in Europe, quum interim
Hiempsal reperitur occultans se in, &Q I should have placed interim
in the text before Hiempsal. Secondly. Ι find that Donatus, on Ter.
Phorm. 11, 1, 62, reads se and not sese ‚· and in the same place the
same Donatus reads in before tuqurio ; and so does Servius on Virg.
AEn. 1, 413 ; and it is really required—C.

3 Mulieris aneillae.] The ancients used ancillus and ancilla just as
later writers do famulus and famula ς and mulier ancilla is the same
as mulier ancillans or famulans. Expressions of the like manner we
have, Cat. cap. 31, Patricius homo3 cap. 38, Homines adoleseentes;
Cor. Nep„ Ventus acquil03 Ter., Mulier meretrix; Cic„ Homo gla-
diator, Mart. Fama anus—M.

stIuliem's ancillae] This seems to me an ἀρχᾰίισμος, or antiqua lo-
quendi ratio. Dictys Cretensis, a great imitator of our author, has
these words in lib. 5, c. 7, Avis aquila stridore magno immittit sese,
where the annotator (Ι believe Mrs. Dacier), says, Nempe aquila est
adjectivum. Credat Judaeus Apella; non ego. We find, in Homer,
two nouns joined together3 one I may call, perham, the generic, or
generieal, and the other the specific or descriptive3 as δμωαίι γυναῖκες,
Il. 9, V. 473, et alibi. ἀνδρῶν ignium, Il. 9, V. 520, et ib. 535, and 540.

both poet-ic and prose writers to use, what grammarians. call vem-&070⁶
ἀντὶ κινητικῶν. See Gregory on Dialect., p. 45, and a host of autho-
rities cited there by the most learned Kb'en. We have ἄνδρας *yagara-05
