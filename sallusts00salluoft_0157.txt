SALLUSTII JUGURTHINUM. 1 45

pestis ejecta,⁵ -laeti pacem agitabamus ; quippe quis hostis
nullus, nisi forte quem jussissetiS. Ecce autem, ex im-

⁹ tentia solis Acrior, et Boreae penetrabile fagus adurat3 for the verb
adurat refers very well to the sun and cold, as Servius remarks, but
not to tenues pluviae. We must understand noceant, or something si·-
milar, as Linacer and Ramus have observed. Here again, the verb
understood is coloured from the verb expressed, as adurere and nocere
are allied in signification, which is also the case in this passage from
Liv. 3, 69, Esquilias quidem ab hoste prope captas, et scandentem in
aggerem Volscum hostem nemo submovit 3 where to the former clause
we must supply nemo defendit. See Walker on Lucian, in Charon,
where he quotes Xenophon, Rogo-t. 1. 2, c. 4, for a similar construc-
tion. Defendit, which is understood in the last adduced sentence of
Livy, denotes absolute and real defence3 submoveo, negative and re—
lative in some measure, therefore the one verb receives a tincture or
colouring from the other, as my friend, Mr. O'Grady, quem honoris
causa nomino, remarked to me some time ago. Virg. AEn. 7, v. 187,
where succinctus refers to trabea, but not to litu03 and AEn. 3, v. 618,
Domus sanie dapibusque cruentis ; and AEn. 6, v. 420, where saporata
(as it should be read) refers to melle, and not frugibus. See Turneb.
Advers. lib. 28, e. 453 and AEn. 5, v. 340, where implere does not
apply to prima ora. See there Davidson3 see also Gronov. on Statius,
c. 28, sub fin, where he cites, Virg. nec jam amplius armis 3 sed votis
precibusque Jubent exposcere pacem. Ubi videndus Servius; and
Homer, neo» καὶ ἷινον εδοντεςς and Manilius, and Tacitus. See Er-

⁷ nesti, on Xenophon's Memorab. lib. 2, init. Cic. lib. 2, de Finib. Tor-

quatus sibi torquem et cognomen induit, et lib. 1, Tuscul„ Et vadit
in eundem carcerem, et in eundem scyphum Theramenes. Virg. AEn.
9, Seu pacem seu bella geram. Read Quinctilian3 Hom. IL 3, v. 73,
φιλας-ητα καὶ ορκια πως-ιι raptore-25, and elsewhere. See the last Il.
v. 8, and there Eustathius. Cic. to Atticus, Fortuna, qua illi floren-
tissima, nos duriore conflictati videmur3 where conflictati can only
agree with the second member ; in the first, we must understand usi
says Scioppius. Sallust, Catil. 2, Quae homines arant, navigant, aedi-
ficant, virtuti omnia parent. Ter. Eunuch. p. 2, 113, Dies noctesque
me ames, me desideres, me somnies, &c Sallust, Jug. 42, Multos
mortales ferro aut fuga extinxit. J ug. 63, Etiam tum alios magistra-
