care of the works of the camp3 they had the honour of wearing a gold
ring, in the same manner as the equites. Their office being esteemed
very honourable, was much coveted3 and therefore, to make way for

the promotion of as many as possible, their command lasted but six
months. See Jug. cap. xlv. note 1.-M.

⁷ Praefectus] Tbere were many kinds of praefecti ς but when Prae-
fectus is simply put by itself, as here, without a restrictive or explica-
tory word joined with it, then generally it denotes the Praefectus auxi-
liarium cohortium atque sociorum, which was a station much of the
same honour and command among the auxiliaries and affies, as a tri-
bune among the legionaries.—M.

⁸ Leqatus] The Legati were next the general in power, and used
to command, by his appointment, some part of the army in the day of
battle, and the whole in the general’s absence. There were several of
them in an army, and the general commonly used them as his coun-
sellors or advisers in all cases of importance or difficulty—M.

LX. ¹ Petreius tubo} siynum dat.] i. e. dari jubet ; for we should not
suppose that Petreius was a trumpeter. It is usual with the Greek and
Latin authors to represent a person as doiny himself what he orders,
authorizes‚ or permits to be done, and so, in the New Testament, Pi-
late is said to have scourged om· blessed Redeemer3 whereas he only
authorized or permitted it. In Theophrast's Charact. c. 8, we have

interpreter, Casaubon, νίκας λέγητε-ες καὶ διηγούμενοι. Sicut apud Aris-
totelem de Caelo, lib. ll, c. 1, et aliis multis locis, οἵ γεννωντες τᾶν
οὐρανὸν, pro eo quod est οἶ λέγοντες τὸν οὐρανὸν εἶναι ymnum-5». Poetis
haec figura dicendi admodum familiaris, ut cum dicitur Lycophroni
Capaneus Thebarum muros, στερῤᾆ δικέλλῃ &ovo-naviam, valido ligone
subruisse, hoc est, prorupisse ad subruendum 3 nam ille quidem nihil
quicquam effecit. Apud Maronem Ecl. 6, v. 46, Silenus solatur Pasi-
Phaen, h. e. canit quomodo ei solatium adhiberi potuerit. Vid. ejus-
