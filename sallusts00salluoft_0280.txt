2 6 6 SALLUSTII J UGURTHLNUM.

vestra consilia accusantur, qui mihi summum honorem,
et maxumum negotium imposuistis3 etiam atque etiam
reputate, num id poeuitundum sit. Non possum fidei
caussa imagines, neque triumphos, aut consulatus majo·
rum meorum ostentare; at, si res postulet, hastas, vexil-
lum, phaleras‚¹⁰ alia militaria dona: praeterea cicatrices
advorso corpore-¹¹ Hae sunt meae imagines, haec nobili·
tas, non haereditate relicta, ut illa illis, sed quae¹² ego
plurimis laboribus et periculis quaesivi. Non sunt eom-
posita verba mea : parum id facio :¹³ ipsa se virtus satis

¹⁰ Hastas nez-illum, phaleras.] These were rewards commonly give-n
by a general to such of his men as had signalized themselves in any
action. The hasta was a fine spear of wood, without any iron ou it,
thence called hasta pura3 such an one as Sylvius is represented to lean
upon, Virg. AEneid. 6, v. 760, Pur& juvenis qui nititur hasta. The
vexillum was a standard curiously wrought, and of valuable materials.
The phalerae were of two kinds 3 oue being a suit of rich trappings for
a horse ; but whether these trappings were applied as au ornament to
the horse's forehead, to the sides of his head, or to his breast, authors
are not agreed. The other sort of phalerae was worn by men, and is
supposed to have been a collar, or chain of gold that surrounded the
neck, and hung down upon the breast. Besides these, many other mi-
litary rewards were in use among the Romans, such as the torques,
armillae. paterae, and the coronae of various kinds—M.

¹¹ Cicatrices advorso corpora] Scars or wounds on the breast,¹ or
fore part of the body, were honourable, as being received with the face
to the enemy; but wounds or scars on the back were disgraceful, as
signisying that the person was a coward‚ and had received them whilst
he was running away.—M.

¹² Relicta. ut illa illis, sed quoe.] Relicta, illa, and quae, are plural
and neuter, referring to imagines and nobilitas-M.

¹³ Parum id facia] Propria notione intellige, ut frequenter in ser-
mone negligentiore, quem noster hic studiose quaesivit, pro non id ego
agn, nimirum, ut verba mea sint composita—M.
