aspera foedaque evenerant.

XXVII. Igitur C. Manlium Faesulas, atque in eam
partem Etruriae, Septimium quemdam Camertem¹ in
agrum² Picenum, C. Julium in Apuliam dimisit3 prae-
terea alium alio, quem ubique opportunum sibi fore cre-

Pioenum.—M.

¹ In agrum] Ayer, commonly rendered territory or district, was

⁴ Dies noctesque] Pius est quam diu noctuque, et notat continua-
ationem—M.

⁵ Postremo, ubi multa ayitanti nihil procedit, δια] Procedit, suc-
ceeds. So in Jugurth. c. 25, Quod ubi secus procedit, &c., 353 sin id
