14 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

neath, c. a, ‘⁴ Coepere se quisque extollere,” quoted by Sanctius, in his
Minerva, lib. 4, c. 10, p. 7173 where you may see a variety of ex-
amples of this construction, and many in the note of Perizonius. Itis
not quisque that takes the plural verb, caepere, but coepit is understood.
——Broukhusius on Propertius, 3, 7, 20.-C.

³ Bello tentare] Tentare is here put for tentabant, a mode of ex-
pression familiar not only to Sallust, but usual in most historians 3 who,
to render their periods smooth and glib, and make their language keep
pace, in some sort, with the quickness of the actions they would ex-
press, and with the fire of their own imagination, generally affect the
use of infinitives, and neglect the indicatives as more clogged and heavy.
It is needless to adduce instances3 the next sentence is one, presently
after you have five, and almost every chapter will afford mora—M.

⁴ Parente-que] By parentes is chiefly meant, in this place, the peo-
ple that were superannuate, and thereby rendered unfit for the ser-
viee-M.
