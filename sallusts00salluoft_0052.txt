40 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

festum inimicum Cn. Pompeio cognoverat. Neque
tamen senatus provinciam invitus dederat; quippe soe-
dum hominem a republica procul esse volebat: simul,
quia boni quamplures praesidium in eo putabant ε et jam
tum potentia Cn. Pompeii formidolosa erat. Sed is
Piso, in provinciam³ ab equitibus Hispanis, quos in ex-
ercitu ductabat, iter faciens, occisus est. Sunt qui ita
dicunt,⁴ imperia ejus injusta, superba, crudelia, barbaros

Praetors (and most of the provinces, except the two allotted for the
Consuls, were governed by Praetors) were not only supreme judges in
an matters within their own provinces, but had, when occasion re-
quired, the command of armies3 and were in all respects invested with
the same authority in their own provinces and armies, as the Consule
were in their's. A person sent to officiate in lieu of the Consul or Praetor
was called Proconsul or Propraet0r3 or writing separately, he was said
to be missus pro Consule or pro Funera—M.

⁸ In provinciam] must be explained here intra provinciam, or in

in Spain, and not upon the road thither. This appears», too, from Sal-
lust himself, cap. 21, where Catiline tells the conspirators, Esse in His-
pania Pisonem3 which he could not have said, had he been murdered
by the way. Nor need the construction surprise us3 for not only Sal-
lust, but several other authors, especially the ancients, make frequently
the preposition in govern the accusative or ablative promiscuously,
without regard to grammatical motion and rest. Cap. xi„ Exercitum,
quem in Asiam ductaverat. ‚J ug. cap. cxii., Cum talem virum in po-
testatem haberet. Plaut. Cas. act. ii. sc. 3, ver. 26, Ubi in lustra
jacuisti. Terent. Eunuch. act. ii. sc. 2, ver. 29, In tantum honorem
esse. Quinctil. VI. cap. ii. p. 523, Neque enim sunt motus in nostram
potestatem—M.

⁴ Sunt qui ita dicunt, &c.] I think with Bentley, on Horace, that
sunt qui dicunt, and sunt qm· dicant, are both good, though Ernesti
seems to deny it, and to think that the verb should always be in the
subjunctive mood. YVhen the verb snm is in a past tense, followed by
