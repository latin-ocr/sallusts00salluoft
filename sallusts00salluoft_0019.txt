SALLUSTII CATILINA. 7

pro labore, desidia3 pro continentia et aequitate,⁴ lubido
atque superbia invasere ; fortuna simul cum moribus im-
mutatur, ita imperium semper ad optumum quemque εἰ
minus b'ono transfertur. Quae homines arant, navigant,
aedificant‚⁵ virtuti omnia parent.6 Sed multi mortales
dediti ventri atque somno, indocti incultique vitam, sicuti

peregrinantes, transegere ; quibus, profecto contra natu-
ram, corpus voluptati, anima oneri fuit, eorum ego vitam

mortemque juxta aestumo, quoniam de utraque siletur.
Verum enimvero is demum mihi vivere atque frui anima
videtur, qui aliquo negotio intentus, praeclari facinoriS‚

⁴ Et aequitate] sse word oequitas, as it stands here opposed to
superbia, signifies one’s behaving as on a level with others, and not
aspiring above them ς but the English language aft'ords no proper word
that I know of to render it byn—M.

⁵ φησι homines arant, δια] This place will not admit of a literal
translation: but the meaning is, that the arts of agriculture, naviga-
tion, and architecture, are al] the offspring and produce of virtue, ι’. e.,
of the powers of the mind well conducted. That this is the sense our
author intends, is obvious, by considering that all along he has been
pointing out the excellency of the intellectual powers 3 such as 1. Their
preference to riches and beauty. 2. Their being more conducive to
success in warlike affairs, than bodily strength. 3. The useful influ-
ence they may have in matters of policy and government. And now,
4. He observes, that it. is to them we owe the invention, the various
improvements, the numberless advantages of agriculture, navigation,
architectum, and all the other arts of life. Apuleius de Mundo, p. 27,
Omne humanae vitae praesidium inqenio ejus est paratum3 cultos αργο-
rum, usus fruyum, artificum, solertia, proventus artium, commodita-
tesque vitae humanae-M.

⁶ Virtute parent is much like that of Horace, ΙΙ. Sat. iii. ver. 94,
Omnis enim res, Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque pulcris Di-
vitiis param—M.
