SALLUSTII J UGURTHINUM. 165

mo viro, placuisse ε ob easdem artis ab Micipsa, non pe-

plura bene atque strenue fecisset, eo animum suum in-

XXIII. ¹ Africa decessisse ratus est.] The strict distinction. says
Anthou, between decedo and discedo, which, however, is seldom ob·
served‚ appears to be this: discedo signifies to make room for another,
to retire merely to a short distance3 but decedo, to leave the place en-
tirely, to depart3 and, generally speaking, in different directions. It
would be easy to prove the fallacy of this distinction; but I shall re-
serve what Ι have to say about it for a note in a new edition of Au-
sonius Popma, which Ι have ready for the press. It is not right to
suffer the young student to be led astray 3 and, as Ι may be unable to
get Popma printed, I say, and boldly assert that, in consequence of
the peculiar power of the words, de and dis, discedere signifies to go
away into various parts or directions, in varias partes abire, or alto-
gether to seek another place; so that the salient notion is that of
change of place. See Jug. 13, In duas partes diseedunt Numidae, e.
28, 54, 56. Hence it is manifest why discedere ab armis, is used;
discedere in sententiam, &c. Decedere signifies to go away, having
left the place which one had, or held. I would say in Latin, De-
cidere notat abire relicto quem quis tenuit loco 3 therefore, it is with
great propriety applied to magistrates leaving a province. In a simi-
lar signification it is applied to a person who is commanded to leave a
place, in which he wished to remain longer, as Jug. c. 28, 35 and 38.

I could give a hundred proofs of what I have stated, if Ι did not wish
brevitati consulere—C.
