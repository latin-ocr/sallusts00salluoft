SALLUSTII J UGURTHIN UM. 2 l 3

LI. Caeterum facies totius negotii varia, incerta, foeda,
atque miserabilis : dispersi a suis pars cedere, alii insequi ;
neque signa neque ordines observare : ubi quemque peri-
culum ceperat, ibi resistere ac propulsare: arma, tela, equi,
viri, hostes, cives permixti ; nihil consilio, neque impe-
rio agi : fors omnia regere.¹ Itaque multum die proces-
serat, cum etiam tum eventus in incerto erat. Denique

LI. ¹ Fors omnia restra] Perizonius, in his Dissertation on Dictys
Cretensis, says, Fors passim et ubique substantivum est apud Sallus-
tium, ut J ug. 51, Fors omnia regere3 cap. 78, Uti fors tulit3 cap. 97,
catervatim uti fors conglobaverat, in nostros incurrunt. But in ch.
12 of J ug. it is an adverb, Forte ejus domo utebatur; which must
have escaped the eye of that most excellent scholar ; and in e. 93, Et
forte in eo, Sco. It seems that every author has had some peculiarity.
Bentley has observed on Hor. that Virg. has never made use of the
word Troicus, but always of Troius ; and I have remarked that Ho-
race always uses cupido in the masculine gender, and Virg. in the fe-
minine, (1 don't mean the god of Love). I believe also that Sallust
always has the indicative mood after quippe qui ; and that Cicero never
has, unless for Milo, 18, 47, Primum certe liberatur Milo, non eo con-
silio profectus esse, ut insidiaretur in via Clodi03 quippe qui ei obvius
futurus omnino non erat. But I have the very best German edition
of it, in which the reading is, Quippe, ei obvius futurus, διε. Horace
uses vulqus always in the neuter gender, according to the great Richard
Bentley; as he has altered the verse in which vulyum stood. Horace
uses nihilo before his comparatives, and never after-3 as, nihilo plus
accipias, nihilo plus explicet, nihilo sapientius, nihilo sapientior, ni-
hilo deterius. Sat. 5, lib. 1, v. 67, as Bentley and others read; and
Torrentius, on Horace, has remarked that Plaut. very frequently uses
nimio plus, nimio minus, nimio aequius, nimio satius, and the like3 but
nimio always precedes, as in Cic. to Att. 10, 8, Ego te nimio plus di-
ligo ; and Lueret. in the places cited by Lambin. ; but Horace always
puts it after3 as, plus nimio. Ι think that Lucretius always uses finis
in the feminine gender; but I cannot be certain, as Ι have not a copy
of his work—C.
