to stand candidate for this high office ς and probably there was some-
thing in Catiline's case which disqualified him at present, and which
he was in hopes of getting removed, and so be in condition to set up
for the consulate. This conjecture is strongly supported by what is
said to this purpose in cap. xviii—M.

Ipsi consulatum petenti mayna spes] The reading in almost all
other editions is petendi, or petundi, which is the same3 but that does
not make good sense. Catiline had an intention or thought of stand-
ing candidate for the consulship, would be good sense, just as we say,
We have thoughts, or an intention of going to Paris; of purchasing a
farm, διας but not hopes of going to Paris3 of purchasing a sarm, &c-
Petenti is to be taken hypothetically, or conditionally, si peteret ; but
as he was determined to seek it, petenti is properly⁷ used. Spes Is often
put absolutely, the context showing in what the hope is placed. This
is the reading in a very old and admirable edition of our author sent
to me from Rome ; and also, Ι perceive, in the edition of Kritzius ς be-
sides, it has the authority of three MSS„ and of Fulvius Ursinus—C.

XVII. ¹ Kalendas Junias.] The Romans had three remarkable
days in each mouth, from which all the rest were denominated and
computed, viz„ the kalends, nones⁷ and ides.

In every month the first day was called kalendae. In the months,
March, May, J uly, and October, the seventh day was called nonae, and
the fifteenth, idus. But in all the other months of the year, the fifth
day was called nonae, and the thirteenth, idus.

In reckoning, they went backward in this manner z—The day pre-
ceding the kalends, nodes, or ides, was called pridie kalendas, or pridie
kalendarum, pridie nonas, or nonarum3 pridie idus, or iduum. Τῇθ
day before this was called tertio kalendas, nonas, idus, i. e., tertio die
ante kalendas, nonas, idus, reckoning inclusively3 or it was expressed
thus, tertio kalendarum, nonarum, iduum, i. e., tertio die kalenda·
rum, ὅτε.

Thus, J anuary lst was called kalendae J anuarii, or, using the month's
