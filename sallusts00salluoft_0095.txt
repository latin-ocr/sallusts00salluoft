⁶ Haruspices respondissent] These were a religious order at Rome,
whose business it was to interpret prodigies, and foretell events by ob-
servat-jons on beasts offered in sacrifice. Respondissem is here a word
of proper style. Cic. i. de div. cap. xxxvi. Pater ad haruspices re-
tulit, qui responderunt, nihil illo puero clarius fore. See Kennet, B. ii.
chap. ἱππ-Μ.

⁷ In liberis custodiis] It was a compliment sometimes paid to cri-
minals of high birth and distinction, that they were not sent to the
common prison, but committed to the custody of the Consuls, Praetors.
AEdiles, or persons who became bail for them ·, and this kind of con-
finement was caUed libera custodia.—M.

⁸ AEdilis.] So called ab aedibus curandis. These were magistrates,
four in number, whereof two were elected out of the commons, and
were called AEdiles plebis ; the other two were chosen out of the no-
bility‚ and were named AEdiles curules, because they were allowed the
honour of using the sella curulis, which was a chair of state made of
ivory, on which they sat in their chariots. The office of the AEdiles
was to inspect the building and reparation of public edifices, such as
temples, theatres‚ baths, &c.‚ to take care the roads were kept in good
repair, to rectify weights and measures, to regulate the games and
public diversions. Besides these four AEdiles‚ Julius Caesar, A. U. 710,
added two more out of the nobility, who were called AEdiles cereales,
because their business was to inspect the public stores of corn, super*
vise all commodities exposed to sale in the markets, and punish delin-
quents in matters of buying and seHing.—M.
