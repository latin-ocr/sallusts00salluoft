10 sestertii, and decem sestertia is 10 sestertia, or 10,000 sestertii .-
and decem sestertiam (for sestertiorum) denotes the same number.

3. If a numeral adverb be added, it raises the value 100 times.
Thus decius sestertium signifies ten hundred sestertia, or, which is the
same thing, ten hundred thousand sestertia—M.

⁴ Decrevere] Such words or sentences, as eortius, in clearing Sal-
lust of the false readings, strongly suspected to be spurious, but could
not with absolute certainty throw out, he has enclosed in crotchets or
brackets, thus, [decrevere.]—M.

⁵ Gladiatoriae familiae] The gladiators were a set of wretches, being
mostly condemned persons, malefactors, captiveS, untoward slaves, or
other ruffians, who were trained up by a lanista or fencing-master, on
purpose to furnish diversion to the people on public days, by engaging
before them in mortal combats. Gladiators were first introduced by
D. J unius Brutus, at his father's funeral, about the year of Rome 489.
And this he did in imitation of the ancient heathens, who imagined the
ghosts of deceased persons were appeased and rendered propitious by
human blood. But as the Roman people were much pleased with these
bloody entertainments, they were not long confined to funeral solemni-
ties, but soon became common on almost all public occasions. Every
great man, to ingratiate himself with the people, would exhibit shows
of gladiators (munera yladiatoria). Julius Caesar, in his edileship,
presented them with three hundred and twenty pair. Trajan the Em-
peror exhibited no less than a thousand pair. See a further account
in Kennet, B. v. ch. 4.-M.

⁸ Distribuerentur] There were vast numbers of gladiators at this
time in Rome, and it was thought prudent to have them separated and
dispersed, lest, getting together in a body, they should j0in Catiline.
