XXVII. ¹ Tribunus plebis designatus] In the year of Rome, 260,
the commons having been much discontented, for a long time before,
at seeing the nobility possessed of all the wealth and honours of the
republic, and themselves loaded with all the toil, insisted upon having
magistrates chosen from among themselves, who might secure them
from the oppressiou of the senate and nobility; and accordingly the
tribum· plebes were created. At first only two were appointed, after·
wat-ds five, and at last ten. By the creation of these officers‚ the power
of the senate was very much limited 3 for, under pretence of maintain—
ing the liberties of the people, they approved or rejected, at pleasure,
the decrees of the senate and consuls, and of au other magistrates, ex-
cept the dietators. When the tribunes approved a decree, they sub-
scribed a T ; and when they disapproved of it, they wrote the word
reto οι· vetanus, to forbid or prohibit the execution of it. The persons
of the tribunes were by law deelared sacrosancti, or sacred and invio-
lable. They had a kind of beadle, called viator, who walked before
them. In all the plebiscita, or ordinances of the people, the tribunes
were obliged to be unanimous, at least not to dissent 3 for if but one of
them opposed the ordinance, it was rendered ineffectual. And hence
Jugm-tha, by means of the tribune Baebius, got clear of the inquisition
proposed by Memmius, cap. 34. These tribunes were sometimes ex-
travagantly imperious. They would assemble and dismiss the senate,
imprison the consuls, and were frequently the cause of many dangerous
tumults ; and hence they are called by some authors pestes reipublicae,
and seditiosi mayistratus. They were laid under great restrictione by
Sulla, insomuch that their power was much impaired, nay almost quite
abolished. But this tiibunical power was again restored by Pompey,
as we learn from Sallust, Cat. cap. 38. They were both elected and
entered on their office before the consuls3 and, during this interval,
were, like them, called desiqnati. See Cat. cap. 18, note 2.-M.
