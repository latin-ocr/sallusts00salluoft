³ Secundo mari.] This may be explained two ways. 1. If secundus
be taken as a numeral, to signify that which comes in the second or
next place, then secundo mari may be rendered, the sea being near,
contiguous, or hard by3 that is, according to the English idiom, by
the sea-side, upon the shore, or, as you go along the shore, there is
first Cyrene, &c. 2. If secundus be taken not as a numeral, but asan
adjective, signifying favourable, fair, &c., then secundo mari will be the
same as portuoso mari, or, mari non importuoso. But though the
words will admit of either of these sensas, yet the first is that which
Sallust seems to intend here, as will appear by what is said in note 8
following—M.

⁸ Colonia Ther-edm] Thera is an island in the AEgean sea, on the
north of Crete: hence Therei Thereorum, or more Graeco, Ther-eon.
This colony was sent from Thera by advice of the oracle of Delphos,
mider the conduct of Aristaeus Battus ; who, upon his arriving in
Africa, built a city, and called it Cyrene, either from the mountain
Cyra, on which it was founded, or from a young lady named Cyrene,
whom, upon his landing‚ he found there. See the history of this at
large in Justin. xiii. cap. 7.-M.

⁷ Duae Syr-tea] These are two gulfs of the sea on the coast of Africa:
the eastermost is called Syrtis major, and the westermost Syrtis minor.
Sallust describes them, cap. 78.—M.

⁸ Philendn aroe.] ΡΙιιἸεπὸη is also the Greek genitive, instead of
Philenorum. The Phileni were two brothers, Carthaginians, who, to
serve their country, condescended to be here buried alive3 to the ho-
nour of whose memory, the Carthaginians erected the altars here men-
tioned⁷ as Sallust informs us, cap. 7 9. Now these Aroe Philenczn were
situated between Cyrene and Syrtis major, whereas our author seems
to place them to the west of both the Syrtes. But the reader must ob-
ser-ve, that the words of Sallust are, Secundo mari, prima, em, i. e.
