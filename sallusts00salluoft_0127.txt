³ Pars hospitem] In the early ages of the world, and even in the
time of the Roman commonweasth, there being no public inns, persons
that travelled lodged in private houses, and returned the favour, when
need required, to those that entertained them. This was frequently
the occasion of a very intimate friendship betwixt the parties, inso-
much that they esteemed and treated one another as relations. Hence
the word hospes comes to signify, not only a lodger or guest, but- an
intimate friend or acquaIntance3 and the word hospitium, not only
lodging or entertajnment, but friendship founded upon that bottom,
and was reckoned one of the most sacred and inviolable ties betwixt
man and man—M.
