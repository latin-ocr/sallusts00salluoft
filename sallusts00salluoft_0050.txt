contra illius potentiam crescere: simu] confisum, si con·
juratio valuisset facile apud illos principem se fore.
XVIII. Sed antea item, ponjuravere pauci contra rem-
publicam, in quibus Catilina, de qual quam verissume
potero dicam. L. Tullo, M. Lepido Consulibus, P. Au-
tronius et P. Sulla, designati ConsuleS,²legibus ambitfis³
interrogati poenas dederant. Post paullo Catilina pe-
cuniaruin repetundarum* reus, prohibitus erat consulatum
petere ; quod intra legitumos⁵ dies profiteri nequiverat.

XVIII. ¹ De quei] Scil. conjuratione, referring to the verb conju-
ravenn—M.

De qud, &c.] Some editors have inserted fuit after Catilina, and
read de quo not qud. Sanct.‚ in his Minerva, 2, 9, p. 206, reads, Ca-
tilina fuit de qud ; i. e., he says, Conjuravere conjurationem, de qud
conjuratione. He that wishes may see the long note of Cottius,
Kritzius, &c.—C.

’ Desiynatz' Consules] The Consuls were chosen about the end of
J uly or beginning of August, but did not enter on their office till the
first of J anuary following; during which time they were called Con-
sules desiynati, and in point of honour had the precedence of all the
senators. N.B.—These words have been omitted in Cortius's edition,
through inadvertency, as appears from his notes3 and, therefore, Ι have
restored them—M.

³ Leyibus ambitos] Ambire is to go about and caress the people
for their votes3 and crimen ambitus was when any one made use of
bribes, or other base and corrupt- methods for this end 3 against which
many severe laws were made, called {eyes ambitos, or leyes de ambitu.
-Μ,

⁴ Pecuniarum repetundarum] Extortion or oppression committed
in the provinces by the provincial magistrates, was called crimen pe·
evniat-um repetundarum ; as being a case wherein repetition and resti-

tution was allowed by the senate to the people or party so injured.
-M.

⁵ Intra Ieyitumos dies] Thirty days before the day of election.—M.
