SALLUSTII J UGURTHINUM. 2 3 9

rati, portas clausere : deinde, ubi neque agros vastari, et
eos, qui primi aderant, Numidas equites vident3 rursum
J ugurtham arbitrati, cum magno gaudio obvii procedunt.
Equites peditesque, repente signo dato, alii volgum effu-
sum oppido caedere; alii ad portas festinare; pars turris
capere: ira atque praedae spes amplius, quam lassitudo
posse. Ita Vagenses biduum modo ex perfidia laetati:
civitas magna et opulens poenae cuncta, aut praedae fuit.l
Turpilius, quem praefectum oppidi unum ex omnibus
profugisse, supra ostendimus, jussus a Metello caussam
dicere, postquam sese parum expurgat, condemnatus, ver-
beratusque capite poenas solvit² nam is civis ex Latio erat?

4, 4, note LOU—C.

² Capite poenas solvit] We learn from Plutarch, that Marius was
very pressing to have Turpilius put to death 3 not because he thought
he deserved it, but because he knew him to be a man heartily in the
interest of Metellus. But as the innocence of Turpilius came, soon
after his death, to be discovered, this, among other things, gave occa-
sion to the great hatred which Metellus conceived against Marius—M.

³ Nam is civis ex Latio ema] Though a general in the Roman
army had a very great authority, yet, after the Porcian law, neither
he, nor any one else, could punish a native citizen of Rome with rods
or death ; the highest punishment that could legally be inflicted being
that of banishment. But the people of Latium, and the other allies in
Italy, though they formed, in a sort, part of the coinmonwealth, and
enjoyed several immunities, yet had not this privilege extended to
them; and therefore they might be sentenced to death, or other pun-
ishments, according to the demerit of their crime. And here further
notice, that, before the Porcian law, condemned criminals at Rome
were commonly first scourged or lashed with rods, and then put to
death; accordingly we find this form of procedure observed here in
the case of Turpilius. See Cat. cap. 2, note 5.-M.
