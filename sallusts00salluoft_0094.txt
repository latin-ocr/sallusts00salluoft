nius Superbus, last King of Rome3 but he ref'using to buy them at
her price, she burned three of them, and asked the same price for the
remaining six. He looked upon her as distracted3 upon which she
burned three more, and came⁴and demanded the same sum for the rest.
The King, surprised at the woman's conduct, consulted the Augurs,
and by their advice bought the remaining three at the full price. The
woman went off, and was never more seen. These books were deposi-
ted in a stone chest in the Capitol. They were said to contain the fate
of the empire, and were consulted as oracles in times of public ca-
lamity.-M.

⁵ Cui fatum urbis potinZ] Fatum is here for fatale, or fato decretum,
fixum, or ratum, a meaning it has in Cic. de Fato, c. 12 3 et alteru-
trum fatum est. See there the learned Turnebus. Votum est, simi-
larly used for optandum est, or something like it3 so ευχη and εὐχάι
in Greek. See the very learned K'oen on Gregor. on Dialects, p. 55.
Sect. 64, Attic Dialect, who cites Quintilian’s Institut. Orat. book 12,
p. 1070. Sed hoc votum est et rara felicitas. He also refers to
Davis on Cic. Tuscul. Quaest. p. 149. To which I add Corn. Celsus,
book 6, c. 6, p. 348. Si quidem sub his oeulis plerumque rumpitur,
votumque est, ut tantum exulceretur, at which place Casaubon says in
a short note, Eleganter hoc positum pro eo, quod Graeci dicerent aya-
aen‘ro» ἄν εἴη. Τ118 same Celsus, book 3, c. 4, in the beginning. Id
votum est : sed fere, &c. So Themistius‚ Orat. 6, p. 161, of the prin-
oeps edit. of Petavius3 ὅτε ἀγαπητὸν nv μὴ ελαττὸο-αι, &c. Cum ta-
men praeclare nobiscum agi videatur, &c., Petavius renders it. See
also Orat. 12, p. 282, of the edition of the same learned Jesuit: «τοῖς
Σὶ ἀγαπητὸν εἶ ’γνωρίζουσα τοῖς δοςυφὸςοις, διο. Aristotel. Eth. ad
Nicom. lib. ult. c. 9. Ἀγαπητδν δε ἴσος ἐστΐν, εἰ, &c. Praeclare autem
fortasse nobiscum agatur, διο. V otivus is similarly used by Trebellius
Pollio, in the life of the two Gallieni. Constabat autem censuram
parentis eum ferre non potuisse, votivumque illi fuisse, quod immi-
nentem cervicibus suis gravitatem paternam non haberet.—C.
