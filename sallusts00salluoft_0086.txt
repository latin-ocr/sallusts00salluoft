74 SALLUSTII CATILINA.

imminutae, paucorum potentia crevit. Hi magistratus,
provinciaS, aliaque omnia tenere: ipsi innoxii, florentes,
sine metu aetatem agere, caeteros judiciis terrere, quo
plebem in magistratu placidius tractarent.l Sed ubi

tme plebem placidias, signifies to manage the people in a softer or
more pacific manner, so as not to incense them against the nobility.

who had engrossed the public management, looked upon the Tribunes
of the commosis as the only persons who formerly did, or now could
thwart their designs‚ and give a check to their growing power by ex—

resentment fall heavy upon all the Tribunes, when out of office, who
had exerted themselves that way, and upon all others too, who dis-
covered a spirit of this nature3 to the end that no person, upon his
being made a Tribune of the eommons, might dare, for the future, to
make any attempts of this kind, or oppose their measures by spiriting
up the people against them. See J ug. cap. xxvii. note 1.—M.
