XXV. Fuere, qui exercit-um in A fi‘icam mittendum censerent] ⁴
Fuerunt, or fuere, or fuerant qui, (aliqui or nonnulli being understood
as the subJect to fuerunt, &c.‚) must have the following verb always
in the subjunctive, and always in the imperfect subjunctive, as Bent-
ley has observed on Horace3 80, beneath, c. 33, Fuere, qui auro cor-
rupti, elephantos Jugurthae traderent. An ignorance of this idiom has
caused Hutchinson to write bad Latin in a note on the 5th Book of
Xenophon’s Anabasis, p. 415, ed. of Cambridge, 17 85. His words
are, Fuere, qui distinctionem posuerunt inter, διο. All schoolboys
know that ut signifying that, governs the subjunctive mood3 yet this
same learned gentleman hae, doubtless, through a μνημονικον &merny-a,
used it wit-h the indicative, in a note on the Κυςοσαιδ. book 2, p. 124,
Quo factum, ut eliminata prisca lectione, cujus significatio fugerat im—

rit. These errors, and many more that Ι could produce from the writ-
ings of consummately learned men, cause me to rejoice at having oom-
plied with the suggestion of an erudite and esteemed friend, Dr. Harte,
“dyc-*Ari δὲ ταραωφασῖς ἔστιν ‘evulgans’ which suggestion was, that Ῑ
should transcribe my notes from Latin, in which 1 had originally
written them, into English, in order to preserve uniformity3 Maii-’s
being in English. See also e. 36, Aefuere, qui tum Albinum haud
ignarum consilii regis existumarent, &c. Such is the construction of
sunt, or ficerunt, with a passive particip1e3 as in J ug. c. 41, Nam ubi
primum reperti sunt, qui veram gloriam injustae potentiae antepone-
rent, &c. A great many learned friends of mine have advised me to
translate Sallust into English3 but I could not be induced to comply
with their monition, in consequence of being convinced, first, that
translations are the bane of schoolboys, notwithstanding what John
Clarke and others have written, in order to prove the contrary3 and,
secondly, from perceiving so many and flagrant errors committed by
men twenty times more learned than I am. If this were the place, 1
would amuse the reader by instancing a few egregious mistakes made
by translators. I cannot refrain from mentioning one or two of the
