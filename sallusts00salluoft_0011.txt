not been a desideratum in classical literature. Ι have
given the excellent little notes of Mair, together with my
own, distinguishing them by putting C. at the end os
each of my notes, and M. at the end of each of those
of Mair. My notes were written in Latin about
twenty-four years ago; but a learned friend induced
me to turn them into English. The latharned John
Walker* told me, during one of the last hours I
passed with him, that an edition of Sallust, with good
and critical notes, was very much wanted. I have never
consulted any classical scholar in England or Ireland
respecting any passage of my author. The only assist-
ance I got was a loan of the edition of Kritzius from
Dr. W. D. Sadleir‚ and? should* there be any over-

sights or mistakes in my notes, I heg· of the candid
reader to remember this. Ι have omitted to observe,
that F. Heffisinger, on Cic. Off. I. 6, 7, and Michael
Hesssinger on the same, Ι. 12, 1, and in Observat. An-
tibarb. p. 403, Go‘ering on Cic. de Finib. III. 1, 1, and
Wittenbach on Cic. de Natur. Deor. ΙΙΙ. 6, p. 779, edi-
tion ofCreuser, condemn the use of equidem with any per-
son except the first. As to the text, I have generally fol-
lowed that of the great restaurator of Sallust, CortiuS,
but not alwayS, as a comparison of the texts will show.
I have occasionally restored many pronouns to the text,
which he had expunged from it. I consulted all the
editions and comments Ι was able to find in London,
